DID TRUMP UNSETTLE RUSSIA AND CHINA? LET’S HOPE SO

2017-10-27

The Washington Post reports that President Trump’s statements to the U.N. about North Korea unsettled China and Russia. Trump said that “the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.”

China, through a state controlled newspaper, complained that Trump’s threat will “likely worsen the already volatile situation.” It called Trump’s posture an obstacle to “other countries’ efforts to persuade the two antagonists to talk.”

Russia moaned that “any military conflict means the deaths of civilians.” Russia should know, given the huge number of civilian deaths it has helped inflict in Syria.

If Trump’s speech truly unsettled China, that’s a good thing. If there is a way to end or reduce the menace posed by North Korea, it isn’t by “persuading the two sides [North Korea and the U.S.] to talk.” Rather, it’s through Chinese pressure on North Korea or, better yet, Chinese imposed regime change.

An “unsettled” China is more likely to bring such pressure or impose such change than a China that can rely on the continuation of the status quo.

My sense, though, is that we cannot expect China to help with North Korea under any circumstances except possibly (1) the prospect of Japan and/or South Korea developing nuclear weapons or (2) the conviction that Kim Jong Un is crazy. The status quo is agreeable enough to China. It keeps the U.S. off balance in the region and avoids the collapse of a more or less friendly regime, the resulting influx of refugees to China, and the reunification of the Korean peninsula on unfriendly terms.

I doubt that Kim Jong Un is crazy or that the Chinese view him as such. All of his moves that we know about have been rational and, indeed, have promoted his interests which are (1) staying in power and (2) confronting a hostile world from a position of strength.

If anything, he seems more rationale than his predecessors. North Korea’s nuclear program has made great advances under his leadership. Some attribute this to the fact that, unlike his father, he tolerates failure by his scientists. He thus enables his scientists to take risks. This, in turn, produces rewards in the form of a nuclear program that’s ahead of schedule.

If Kim Jong Un is rationale, he’s unlikely to start a war. It doesn’t hurt, though, for President Trump to remind him of the consequences of starting one and, in so doing, perhaps give China an incentive to help us out.

Though the deterrence model seems applicable to North Korea, we cannot be certain that it won’t launch nukes against the U.S. or its allies. We can be pretty certain that diplomacy won’t work and that the cost of a preemptive strike would be too high given the likelihood that Kim Jong Un can be deterred.

Where does that leave us? It leaves us, I think, with two things we should be focusing on: (1) working feverishly on missile defense, (2) assisting Japan and South Korea militarily, especially with a nuclear program if that’s the direction in which they want to go.

THE IMPORTANT STORY YOU’RE NOT HEARING MUCH ABOUT

2017-10-18
What would you think of someone who got sued, lost in court, and celebrated the loss? You’d think there is something seriously amiss. In fact this has been the longstanding practice of a number of federal agencies, who actively cooperate with activist groups (invariably on the left) to set up lawsuits against agencies that result in the agencies having more power and instituting more regulations.

To give a good example, when the EPA lost the 2007 case of Massachusetts vs. EPA (that was the one that said the EPA could regulate greenhouse gas emissions), employees at EPA opened champagne to celebrate their “loss” at the Supreme Court. Much of the time these legal actions never actually make it very far in court, because the agency will “settle” with the plaintiffs through a consent decree, which means in practice that the agency conveniently consents to having more power. It is called “sue and settle,” but I call this “crony administration.” Much of the time these faux lawsuits are filed with the active participation of the agency, making a mockery of the rule of law.

This corrupt racket has been going on for 30 years or more, and neither of the previous Bush administrations did anything to stop it. Last week EPA administrator Scott Pruitt said the EPA would end the practice. Pruitt’s announcement reads, in part: “The days of this regulation through litigation, are terminated. The EPA will not resolve litigation through backroom deals with any type of special interest group.” Pruitt also announced steps to increase transparency about all matters under litigation—lifting the veil on this whole racket—so people can see what the activist groups are trying to do. I am sure environmental groups are in a rage about this, but are remaining remarkably quiet because they likely know that greater public transparency about this racket is the last thing they want.

Pruitt issued a sparkling good memo explaining more of the legal and constitutional background of his step. My favorite part of this memo are footnotes 8, 9, and 10, where Pruitt cites the Federalist Papers and other founders on the importance of the separation of powers, which the administrative state has been trampling for decades. This has to be the first time an EPA administrator has ever cited The Federalist in an official document. I imagine Gina McCarthy, Obama’s EPA head, probably never heard of The Federalist.

Here are he footnotes in full:

8 In The Federalist Number 47, James Madison wrote: One of the principal objections inculcated by the more respectable adversaries to the constitution, is its supposed violation of the political maxim, that the legislative, executive and judiciary departments ought to be separate and distinct. In the structure of the federal government, no regard, it is said, seems to have been paid to this essential precaution in favor of liberty. The several departments of power are distributed and blended in such a manner, as at once to destroy all symmetry and beauty of form; and to expose some of the essential parts of the edifice to the danger of being crushed by the disproportionate weight of other parts. No political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic value or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty than that on which the objection is founded. The accumulation of all powers legislative, executive and judiciary in the same hands, whether of one, a few or many, and whether hereditary, self appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny. Were the federal constitution therefore really chargeable with this accumulation of power or with a mixture of powers having a dangerous tendency to such an accumulation, no further arguments would be necessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the system. I persuade myself however, that it will be made apparent to every one, that the charge cannot be supported, and that the maxim on which it relies, has been totally misconceived and misapplied. In order to form correct ideas on this important subject, it will be proper to investigate the sense, in which the preservation of liberty requires, that the three great departments of power should be separate and distinct. The Federalist No. 47 (James Madison) (emphasis added).

9 “The leading principle of our Constitution is the independence of the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary of each other.” Thomas Jefferson to George Hay, 1807. FE 9:59 (emphasis added). “The Constitution intended that the three great branches of the government should be co-ordinate and independent of each other. As to acts, therefore, which are to be done by either, it has given no control to another branch. . . . Where different branches have to act in their respective lines, finally and without appeal, under any law, they may give to it different and opposite constructions. . . . From these different constructions of the same act by different branches, less mischief arises than from giving to any one of them a control over the others.” Thomas Jefferson to George Hay, 1807. ME 11:213 (emphasis added).

10 “The separation of powers inside a government – and each official’s concern that he may be replaced by someone with a different agenda – creates incentives to use the judicial process to obtain an advantage. The consent decree is an important element in the strategy. . . . It is impossible for an agency to promulgate a regulation containing a clause such as ‘My successor cannot amend this regulation.’ But if the clause appears in a consent decree, perhaps the administrator gets his wish to dictate the policies of his successor.” Frank Easterbrook, Justice and Contract in Consent Judgments, 1987 U. Chi. L. Forum 19, 33-34 (1987).

I call this winning for sure.

SINGLE FALLACIES

2017-07-26

Obviously the future of health care policy rests on a knife edge. It is a political game of chicken between whether Republicans have the nerve to roll back the egregious features of Obamacare that will necessarily involve creating gaps in insurance coverage, and Democrats who think that they are in the catbird seat because either the eventual collapse of Obamacare or the defects of a Republican reform will set the table for their real goal: Canadian-style single-payer health care. And just as some conservatives are warming to the idea of a “universal basic income,” here and there you hear a few conservatives say, “Oh what the hell: we may as well get used to the inevitability of single-payer health care. I mean, how bad is Canada, really?”

Much worse than you think. Set aside for the moment the salient fact that one reason Canadian single-payer “works” is that it has private medicine in the United States available as a safety value for its own system. (A lot of Canadian doctors actually practice some of the year in the U.S. after they’ve fulfilled their annual quota of work in Canada.) More damning is a report out recently from the Commonwealth Fund that compares health care systems of eleven health care systems. Canada came in ninth.

It’s a dense report with lots of tables and charts. Brian Lee Crowley get to the heart of the matter in Canada’s National Post:

On measure after measure the data belie the boasts that medicare apologists tout as proof we have the best system in the world. When measuring the equity of our system against the others, we come a pitiful ninth out of 11, despite the fact that “fairness” is the argument most frequently trotted out to defend the status quo. Turns out Canadian health care isn’t all that fair.

Ditto for health-care outcomes. Despite being a fairly high spender, we are not able to turn that money into better outcomes for Canadians. Again, we rank ninth out of 11.

But in what must be the bitterest pill, we come 10th in access. That means that among the 11 systems studied, every one of them gives better access to health-care services except one: the United States. Gives a whole new meaning to the sentiment that we don’t want American-style health care here, doesn’t it?

The only thing I want from a single source is my Scotch whisky.

BLUE GOVERNANCE IN THE EMERALD CITY

2017-07-11
I don’t know quite when it happened, but some time in the last decade or so Seattle decided it was losing too much ground to Portland, Oregon, in the Crazy Liberal Weirdness Department. Sure, Seattle brought us grunge rock (music to invade Poland by, as someone once put it) and the 2000 WTO protests that were the early prototype of today’s “antifa resistance.” But Portland got the TV show!

We’ve already noted the perverse results of Seattle’s minimum wage hike, but now the neo-socialist city council has decided to extend its craziness by imposing a city income tax on high income residents of the city:

SEATTLE — Seattle’s wealthiest would become the only Washington state residents to pay an income tax under legislation approved by the City Council, a measure designed as much to raise revenue as to open a broader discussion about whether the wealthy pay their fair share.

The council voted unanimously Monday to impose a 2.25 percent tax on the city’s highest earners. Personal income in excess of $250,000 for individuals and in excess of $500,000 for married couples filing joint returns would be taxed.

Washington state does not have a state income tax, and there’s some legal question about whether Seattle can institute an income tax. I suppose one way to make Seattle housing more affordable is to cause its wealthier residents to move out of the city limits to Bellevue, Renton, etc.

If the tax goes into effect, we’ll be back with follow-up stories about how the new tax “unexpectedly” is failing to bring in the predicted revenue. Which will be inevitably followed by raising the rate. Rinse and repeat until you become Detroit.

THE NEXT LIBERAL LAMENTATION

2017-06-25

What’s the most hated Supreme Court decision on the left of the last few years? Why, Citizens United, of course, which leftists blame for just about every bad imaginable. Aggrieved leftists often compare it to the Dred Scott decision—seriously, they do.

So if Justice Anthony Kennedy announces his retirement from the Court tomorrow, can we expect to see liberal headlines saying, “Left Celebrates as Author of Modern ‘Dred Scott’ Decision Retires”? Because it was in fact Kennedy who wrote the Citizens United opinion. And let’s not forget that he was also in the four-justice conservative minority that wanted to strike down Obamacare in toto in 2012 (it was Roberts that let us down on that one, as you’ll remember). I suspect Kennedy may also share the growing reservations among jurists about the Chevron doctrine of judicial deference to the administrative state.

The point is, Kennedy has been unreliable and inconsistent from every point of view—he totally botched property rights again (you’d have thought he’d learned a lesson from the 2005 Kelo case) with his opinion this last week in Murr v. Wisconsin—but there is a lot for the left to dislike about Kennedy, too. I actually doubt he’ll retire; I think he rather likes being the de facto Chief Justice once again, which he wouldn’t be if Merrick Garland had been confirmed last year and the Court had tilted decisively left. But with the arrival of Gorsuch, he’s back to being in the catbird seat on every important case.

But if he does retire tomorrow, watch for liberals to lose completely whatever little sanity they have left. Just take in the Washington Post‘s Ruth Marcus (who hates Citizens United, but omits any mention of Kennedy’s provenance of the decision in her plea for Kennedy to stay on):

The terrifying and terrible prospect of Justice Kennedy retiring

The end of the Supreme Court term looms, and with it the prospect — the terrifying prospect — of a retirement. . .  [H]is departure would be terrible for the court and terrible for the country. It could not come at a worse time. . .

Justice Kennedy, perhaps it is unfair to pile all this onto your shoulders, but is it really wise to subject an already divided country to even more turbulence? And to another nomination by this president, with his evident ignorance of the role of the judiciary and disdain for judicial independence?

Your career has been characterized by insistence on civility, respect for the dignity of all individuals and commitment to the rule of law — qualities absent in our president. Just read Trump’s tweets and ask yourself: Do I really want my successor named by this man?

This isn’t an argument. It’s a primal scream from someone who still can’t accept the outcome of an election. (Also missing: a note about Harry Reid going first in nuking the filibuster for judicial appointments, which will allow Trump more latitude in making a Court appointment. Thank you once again Harry!)

Let the terror begin. And if Senate Republicans are smart, they’ll add in hefty funding for mental health services for liberals in their Obamacare repeal/replace bill.

WHY ARE LIBERALS ALWAYS SO UPSET?

2017-06-15

Yesterday on our VIP live webcast, we talked briefly about the sources of Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS), which I argue predates Trump and would likely be present if any other Republican, even mild-mannered Jeb Bush, were in the White House right now. TDS has its roots in the lazy presumption that liberalism represents “the side of history,” as though “History” is a self-conscious thing with only one direction. This presumption is, in fact, a secular version of divine Providence. Hence for liberals, when they lose elections, the fault is not theirs or their candidate’s, but represents some kind of ghastly mistake if not a fraud against history. Cue up Russians, dirty tricks, hanging chads, whatever. A large portion of the left has not accepted the legitimacy of each Republican president starting with Nixon.

If you want to see this at work, I refer you to a book out in March from Ruy Tiexeira of the Center for American Progress, The Optimistic Left: Why the 21st Century Will Be Better Than You Think. I’ve met Ruy a couple of times, and unlike many people on the left he is a pleasant human being to know. In fact we once had a long lunch discussing some ideas for a conference we might do together, but both got too busy to follow up. I think Ruy is on to something in this book, namely, that liberalism became a dark and pessimistic creed starting in the 1960s and 1970s, and that this has been debilitating to liberalism. His publisher sent me the advance galleys of the book last fall, which I put in my reading stack and didn’t get back to, until I saw Damon Linker of The Week take after Teixeria in a recent column, saying that “Because his optimism inspires such complacency, Teixeira is a dangerous man for Democrats to have around.”

Well now. I decided to pick up the galleys and have a look. And while I think much of the book is creditable even if mistaken on policy, there were two early sentences that brought me up short, starting with this one on page 1: “. . . Democrats have won three straight presidential elections. . .” Wait, what the hell is he talking about? Is he talking about FDR in 1940? I thought this book was about current times.

Then, page 3: “Barack Obama’s two presidential victories were followed by routs in the Congressional elections of 2010 and 2014, and new president Hillary Clinton. . .” (Emphasis added.) Ah—now I get it. Of course books have to be written with long lead times and anticipate events to some extent, but if you’re a liberal and you think History is on your side, and you believe the polls (I did) that Hillary was a lock to beat Donald Trump, then the comedown after losing to Donald Trump must be the psychic equivalent to withdrawals after you run out of heroin.

Once upon a time, liberals like John Stuart Mill understood that the progress of civilization was not necessarily an irreversible process, and today’s left is doing it’s best to prove Mill was right.
