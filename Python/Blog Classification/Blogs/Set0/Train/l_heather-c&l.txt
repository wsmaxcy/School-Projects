Trump's Fox Cheerleaders Defend His Flip-Flop On Russia: He Was 'Taken Out Of Context'

2017-11-12

Donald Trump has been met with harsh criticism for remarks he made on Air Force One this Saturday, and as reported by The Hill, was immediately backtracking and attempting to "clarify" his remarks: Trump clarifies Putin comments: 'I'm with our agencies' on election meddling:

President Trump clarified his comments Sunday on whether he believes Russia meddled in the U.S. 2016 presidential election, saying, "I believe in our intel agencies."

Trump had told reporters on Air Force One Saturday that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin when he says he didn't meddle in the election.

“Every time he sees me he says, ‘I didn’t do that,’ and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it," Trump said Saturday.

The comment quickly became the subject of backlash, prompting Trump to clarify the comments in a joint press conference with Vietnam President Tran Dai Quang on Sunday morning local time.

"What I said is, I believe [Putin] believes that," Trump said at the press conference in Hanoi, Vietnam. "I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election. As to whether I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies, especially as currently constituted, with their leadership."

"I believe in our intel agencies. I've worked with them very strongly," Trump added.

Trump and Putin met Saturday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders' Meeting in Danang, Vietnam. Trump said Putin is “very insulted” by the suggestion Moscow attempted to hack the election.

This had Trump's best friends on his favorite morning show up in arms, attacking the non-existent so-called "liberal media" for being unfair to their Dear Leader:

JENKINS: Now we need to just do a quick explanation for our viewers to get some context, and that is, the president was in a gaggle, meaning there was no cameras there and he was asked about his meeting with Putin, and he said he believes Putin means what he says. The press reporting then, that he believes Vladimir Putin on no meddling, but, it was taken out of context as he felt compelled to clarify, which is he says, well I believe Putin believes that, but, what we need to do is move on.

And our chief White House correspondent John Roberts made it very clear that it was a case of the press taking out of context and not listening to the president's inflection when he was speaking to them.

HUNTSMAN: Right. John Roberts, who's overseas on this trip was tweeting yesterday, saying how frustrated he was to see the coverage back at home, and how it wasn't honest. It wasn't accurate, because what many were saying yesterday after this happened was that president Trump didn't believe there was meddling in the election, which he's now come out and said I stand with our intelligence community, which have come out and said Russia did try to meddle in the election, so it's so important here to get the facts right.

The ones missing the context were his cheerleaders on Fox "news" who conveniently forgot to mention Trump's additional remarks attacking the intelligence agency leaders: Trump slams former US intel leaders as 'political hacks':

President Trump on Saturday lashed out at U.S. intelligence leaders for their conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, calling them “political hacks” and slamming the investigations into Russian interference as a “Democratic hit job.”

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump blasted former U.S. intelligence officials by name, including former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former FBI Director James Comey.

"I mean, give me a break, they are political hacks," Trump said, according to White House pool reports. He was discussing the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia sought to influence the 2016 election in favor of Trump.

"So you look at it, I mean, you have Brennan, you have Clapper and you have Comey," he continued. "Comey is proven now to be a liar and he is proven now to be a leaker.”

“So you look at that and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with them," he continued, referring to Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Trump said that the investigation into Russian interference in the election was a “Democratic-inspired thing” and a “pure hit job."


Trump went on to say that he wasn’t going to “argue” with Putin about whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election.

“He said he didn’t meddle, he said he didn’t meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times,” Trump said, according to pool reports.

“I can’t stand there and argue with him, I would rather have him get out of Syria, I would rather get to work with him on the Ukraine," he added.

Yes, context does matter. Just not to the liars on Fox.

Pelosi On Impeaching Trump: 'Not Someplace That I Think We Should Go'

2017-11-05

With a growing number of Democrats in the House calling for it, along with millionaire Tom Steyer out there running ads demanding they promise to impeach Trump if they take back the House in 2018, Republicans like Lindsey Graham are already using the issue as a rallying cry for their voters to gin up turnout for the midterm elections (and scare his fellow Republicans into passing their tax cuts for the 1 percent).

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was asked this Sunday on CNN's State of the Union whether or not Democrats will try to immediately impeach Trump if they do manage to win back the House by host Jake Tapper.

Pelosi downplayed Graham's fearmongering, and did her best to dampen any expectations we'll be watching impeachment hearings any time soon:

TAPPER: Well, let's talk about that, because Democratic mega-donor Tom Steyer recently launched a $10 million ad campaign calling for the impeachment of President Trump.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says that if you and the Democrats take the House back in 2018, the first thing you will do is impeach President Trump.

Is that true?

PELOSI: No.

I believe that, whatever we do, we have a responsibility, first and foremost, to unify the nation. Second of all, you can't go down any path without the facts and the law. If that's there, perhaps it will come out in these investigations.

I -- and the left of our party is still annoyed with me for not impeaching President Bush for going into Iraq. What could be worse than that?

But the fact is that we have got to really be saying what this election means to people in their lives. Somebody has some facts that come forth about President Trump, let the chips fall where they may. But it's not someplace that I think we should go.

TAPPER: Not a priority for you.

PELOSI: No.

TAPPER: OK.

PELOSI: And, again, I don't want to dampen anybody's enthusiasm for what they believe, because a lot of people in our country think that the president should be impeached.



But that -- that's not a decision. That isn't what our election is about. Our election is about meeting the needs of the American people, stopping this tax bill right now, which is an insult to the intelligence of the American people, an assault on their financial security. That's what we should be talking about.

I'm sure Pelosi is trying not to give Republicans any more excuses to use her face as the Wicked Witch of the West in every other local campaign ad they run for the midterms. I don't expect it will stop them from doing it anyway.

If Trump's going to actually be removed from office, his own party is going to have to turn on him and help to vote him out. I see no signs that's going to happen any time in the near future, and I'm sure she doesn't either. Maybe that will change if enough of them finally land in prison, but who knows. I sure wouldn't hold my breath waiting for a single one of them to do the right thing.

Nikki Haley Punts When Asked If Trump Supports Path To Citizenship For Dreamers

2017-09-17

United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley made an appearance on CNN's State of the Union this Sunday, and was asked whether or not Trump supports a path to citizenship which is included in the Dream Act, and is supported by the likes of Sen. Lindsey Graham, among others.

While Haley expressed her sympathy for these kids, many of whom were brought to the United States when they were very young by their parents, she refused to say whether Trump would support the idea of them eventually being allowed to become citizens.

BASH: Do you believe that Dreamers should get, not just a right to stay in the U.S., but an actual path to citizenship?

HALEY: Well, first of all, I think that we have to remember that we all feel for Dreamers. We all feel for those that came here, or were brought here without their willingness, or without their understanding that this was going to happen. So we all have a heavy heart for that.

But I also think we have to remember that the United States is a country of laws and we have to always follow those laws. And I think what you're seeing is the president is trying to work with Congress on what is a very difficult situation.

There is no easy answer when it comes to things like this and I think the fact that they're having the back and forth, the fact that they're talking about it I think is important and I think at the end there will be a resolution that they come together with on this as they go forward.

To be fair to Haley, it's hard to say what Trump's attitude towards a path to citizenship is, because 1) it's not entirely clear he understands the issue at all; 2) he's made contradictory statements, so no one really knows what he's going to do. But it does appear that at this point, no matter how he tries to cozy up to Democratic congressional leaders for good press, his administration is doing a full campaign to make Dreamers feel unsafe and in danger of deportation.

Univision Host Blasts Trump And Arizona Republican For Normalizing Racism

2017-08-27

Univision anchor Jorge Ramos took Arizona Republican senator Steve Montenegro to task over his defense of Donald Trump's pardon of former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio on this Sunday's State of the Union on CNN.

Ramos blasted Trump for the damage he's doing to this country, and for normalizing racism, while the state senator stuck to his talking points and attempted to paint any outrage over the pardon as much ado about nothing:

In Arizona Republican State Senator Steve Montenegro’s world, the ground appears to be blue and the sky is green.

This Latino Republican, who migrated with his family to the U.S. from El Salvador when he was 5, seems to be all about turning his back on immigrants now and sucking up to despicable racists like President Donald Trump and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

Montenegro was a guest Sunday morning on CNN’s State of the Union with Jake Tapper, where he went head–to–head with Univision’s Jorge Ramos. In true Republican fashion, where realities are constructed by saying the opposite of the truth, Montenegro—with a straight face and no sense of irony—spoke of Trump’s decision to pardon the racist sheriff, who was convicted of criminal contempt of court over human rights abuses and the racial profiling of Latinos, as a respectful act of enforcing “the rule of law.”

He also repeatedly cited the “hypocrisy from the left,” and attacked President Barack Obama for having pardoned “hundreds of thugs,” including Puerto Rican independence militant Óscar López Rivera, whom Montenegro called an “unrepented terrorist.” (Obama actually commuted López’s sentence after he served nearly four decades in prison.)

“Here you have an 85–year–old man, who frankly has served his country since he was 18, and the best the left can come up with after they do a political persecution on him is a misdemeanor, who even then I don’t think, I don’t believe that was done correctly through the judicial process,” Montenegro said, smiling smugly.

Ramos did his best to fight back against Montenegro’s captious claims, reminding the state senator about where he came from—Central America’s Northern Triangle, where today many immigrants continue fleeing from poverty and unforgiving gang violence.


“I think Senator Montenegro is forgetting that he’s an immigrant from El Salvador, and that Sheriff Joe Arpaio discriminated against many people just like you, senator,” Ramos said. “By pardoning Arpaio, President Trump is defending racism.”

Budget Director Mulvaney Helps Trump Play Dangerous Game On Debt Ceiling Hike

2017-07-30

Hair Furor took to Twitter again yesterday to express his rage at the Republicans in the Senate for failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act:

Unless the Republican Senators are total quitters, Repeal & Replace is not dead! Demand another vote before voting on any other bill!
2:36 PM - Jul 29, 2017

His budget director, Mick Mulvaney, during an appearance on CNN's State of the Union this Sunday, reiterated his boss' demands, and let host Jake Tapper know they were more than willing to play a very dangerous game with the full faith and credit of the United States: Mulvaney: No other votes until Senate votes again on health care:

The Senate should not vote on anything else until it’s voted again on repealing Obamacare, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said Sunday.

Mulvaney said that “yes,” it's official White House policy that the Senate shouldn’t hold a vote on another issue — not even an imminent crisis like raising the debt ceiling— until the Senate votes again on health care.

“In the White House's view, they can't move on in the Senate,” Mulvaney said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “You can't promise folks you're going to do something for seven years, and then not do it.”

The House, which has passed an Obamacare repeal measure, is on its summer break until after Labor Day, but the Senate plans to work at least another two weeks.

In a string of recent tweets, President Donald Trump has urged Republican senators to not “give up” on repealing Obamacare and to continue to work on the issue “unless the Republican senators are total quitters.”

Trump also tweeted about ending "bailouts" for lawmakers’ health care. On Sunday, Mulvaney said that has to do with how much employers can contribute to their plan, not taking away coverage for members and staff.

Fox Heaps Praise On Trump For Saying He'll Work With Putin On Cybersecurity

2017-07-09

If you needed any more proof that the yakkers on Pravda Fox are playing for an audience of one, watch this fawning clip above with the crew on Fox & Friends heaping praise on Trump's latest Tweets, where he promises to work with Putin on cybersecurity after the Russians interfered with our presidential election to help put him in office.

Trump was back on Twitter this morning...

...and the crew on the upskirt couch had nothing but good things to say about him:

HUNTSMAN: Isn't this interesting. I mean, the Democrats already after the meeting were saying he accepted the fact that Russia meddled in the election. He's not going to talk about it again. He's going to let it go.

HEGSETH: He's moving on.

HUNTSMAN: Not only is he still focused on this, this issue. He's now saying he's working with the Russians to make it so it doesn't happen again. He's going like this to the Democrats. He's screwing their guts.

PIRO: But, you know that the Democrats are going to spin this their way and say, oh well, you're not being strong enough if you're working together with him, but isn't that what major world powers do if you want to promote peace in the world? They work together.

HEGSETH: But again, he's promoting the substance. He's saying, we're going to create a cybersecurity unit. Just like he did in the previous two Tweets, which I believe we have as well, which came out just twenty minutes ago.

So he's talking about the ceasefire and he's talking about an impenetrable cybersecurity unit.

HUNTSMAN: If there were collusion between the Russians and President Trump, why would he be talking about this? Why would he be keeping this his focus, right? I mean, wouldn't he have every intention to just not even mention it, as Dan Bongino said just a few minutes ago, he said this is someone clearly who seems to have nothing to hide here.

HEGSETH: Yeah.

HUNTSMAN: He is someone they want to double down on and say “Yes, let's solve this problem. I admit that obviously there was meddling that went on there. Let's figure out how to fix it.”

HEGSETH: Even the new shred this morning in the failing New York Times about so-called meeting that happened, or the meeting that happened at Trump Tower with, they're trying to mix up, dust up even more Russia. It's not even on the front pages of the print edition this morning.

They've got to realize they've got nothing. He knows they've got nothing, and he's known it from the beginning. He will tell you privately and publicly it's a ruse and a witch hunt. So he says hey, it's time to work with them and get it done.

PIRO: As Bongino said, Trump, if he's a spy, is the worst spy in the history of all potential spies, ever.

Everyone feel safer now? I know I sure do. Here are some suggestions for some task force units Trump can get started as well from some of our crew here at C&L.

Shameless Lindsey Graham Wants To 'Move On' From Russiagate By Investigating Clinton Emails

2017-05-19

I really don't know how these people get up and look themselves in the mirror every morning. Republicans have been giving Trump cover at every turn, even if they've previously had some tough talk for him, as we've occasionally heard when he pretends he's going to grow a spine and conscience from Sen. Lindsey Graham, and his BFF and fellow pretend "maverick" John McCain.

Then they're right back to making sure Trump and his band of grifters are never held accountable for whatever their role was in helping the Russians influence the presidential election and refusing to hold him accountable for violating the emoluments clause and using his office to line his and his family's pockets with foreign money at every turn.

And just to add insult to injury, this Thursday on Fox "News," not only was Graham using the appointment of a special counsel to look into Russiagate as an excuse for the Republicans in Congress to weasel out of their oversight duties, Graham also used it as an opening to relaunch their witch hunt into Hillary Clinton's emails: Sen. Lindsey Graham: Congress should abandon Russia investigation, go back to Clinton’s emails:

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Fox News on Thursday that now that special counsel has been appointed to investigate alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, Congress should abandon their own investigations and go back to focusing on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails.

“I don’t know what caused the appointment. I haven’t seen any evidence of a crime yet. The bottom line is I respect the decision, but this pretty much shuts Congress down,” Graham said. “Democrats, you got what you wanted. You got a special counsel. Now we’ll just move on. We’re not prosecutors.”

That doesn’t mean, however, that Graham thinks all of Congress’ investigations should stop.

“There’s a new front opening here. I have reason to believe that there are emails between Clinton campaign officials, democratic operatives to the Department of Justice regarding the Clinton email investigation that happened on Obama’s watch. I have reason to believe those emails exist,” Graham said. “I’m on the Judiciary Committee. And I think it’s important that the Judiciary Committee be given any emails that were directed to the Department of Justice by Clinton campaign officials or operatives because we have jurisdiction over the Department of Justice.”


↓ Story continues below ↓
Graham added that he had not seen the emails, and did not elaborate on why he said he had “reason to believe” they exist.

And as the article at Think Progress also noted, it's another flip flop for Graham:

Graham’s statement is also a dramatic about-face for the senator. At a CNN town hall in May, Graham said that he would support the appointment of a special prosecutor.

“There may be nothing there,” Graham said. “But if there is something there that the FBI believes is criminal in nature, then for sure you need a special prosecutor.”

Republicans and Fox depend on their supporters and viewers having selective amnesia and never remembering anything these hypocrites said a week, a day, or sometimes even an hour before.

GOP Senator Laughably Pretends Republicans Are Holding Trump Accountable

2017-04-23

Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace that he and his fellow Republicans in Congress are "being consistent" with the manner in which they're holding Trump accountable for his behavior in office compared to how they'd behave if we had a Democratic president.

Who really believes they would not have scheduled impeachment hearings if not already impeached a Democrat who was behaving the same way Trump has since taking office? He's violating the Emoluments Clause and using the United States government like a piggy bank to enrich himself and his grifter family, but Sen. Lankford wants us to believe they're actually holding his feet to the fire just because a few of them have said something about all the golf Trump is playing and the fact that he hasn't released his tax returns.

Lankford also had the gall to equate Trump refusing to release his tax returns with the wingnut birthers demanding President Obama's birth certificate back in the day. Yeah, those two things are exactly alike, Senator.

WALLACE: Let's talk about what seems to be a greater willingness among some Republicans in Congress, yourself included, to criticize this president. There are a dozen of you who have said the president should keep his promise and release his tax returns. There are some Republican senators and congressmen in border states who are really questioning whether or not you need a full border wall.

And I want to play for you Senator Joni Ernst in a town hall meeting this week in Iowa. Here she is.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. JONI ERNST, R-IOWA: With the trip to Florida, I do wish that would spend more time in Washington, D.C. That's what we have the White House for.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Senator, what's going on with this increased willingness of Republican members of Congress, including yourself, to criticize this president?

LANKFORD: I think, quite frankly, it’s what Republicans said we will do a few years ago when people challenge us and said, if you had someone in the White House of your own party, would you hold them into account the same way that you're holding President Obama to account? You're finding out that's actually true, that Republicans are consistent to go both ways in this.


↓ Story continues below ↓
Now, listen, in the town hall meetings that I’ve had in the last two weeks and I’ve had 16 of them, in the town hall meetings that I’ve had in the last weeks, I’ve heard some of the same arguments, just with an opposite. Now, people are saying they demand to see Trump's tax returns.

Three years ago, these people were saying they demand to see President Obama’s birth certificate. Three years ago, people are saying President Obama’s traveling all the time, playing golf and he’s played more golf than any president in history. Now, I have progressive constituents saying that President Trump is out there traveling and how much are his costs on it.

So, the same type of arguments are coming up back and forth, but I think what you're finding is, Republicans are being consistent. They are playing it straight to say, if there's an issue, let's raise the issue, regardless of who’s in the White House and be able to help solve the issues that we got. So, I don't see that is inconsistent for us.

John McCain: Syria Strike Not Enough

2017-04-10

Sen. John McCain told Face the Nation host John Dickerson that the Trump administration was "partially to blame" for the chemical attack in Syria and pushed for more bombing raids in Syria:

Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said comments made by people in President Donald Trump’s administration are “partially to blame” for encouraging Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s apparent use of chemical weapons on his people last week.

McCain responded to remarks that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made at the end of March, before the attack, including comments that the Syrian people would determine Assad’s fate, and that removing him from power isn’t a top priority.

“I think it probably was partially to blame,” McCain said. “And Secretary Tillerson basically saying the same thing after kind of contradicting himself and then saying the same thing argues vigorously for a plan and a strategy. As I said again, taking this action I support and was important.”

McCain also said he does “not agree” with Tillerson’s position that the U.S. needs to concentrate on the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) before it can further address Assad’s purported brutality against his own people, saying ISIS and Assad are “totally connected” issues.

“We will take Mosul,” McCain said. “We will take Raqqa. And we’d better have strategies as to how to handle those places once we have won it. But they’re not disconnected from Bashar Assad and the Al Qaeda – the war crimes that have been taking place.”

“You can’t — to a large degree, Bashar Assad, by polarizing the Syrian people have also given rise to ISIS and Al Qaeda,” McCain continued. “So they are both connected. And I believe that the United States of America can address both at the same time. We can walk and chew gum. We have the capability to do both.” [...]

“Well, I think what the president did was an excellent first step, and it was a reversal of the last eight years,” McCain said. “And I think it was important. But it’s now vitally important we develop a strategy, we put that strategy in motion, and we bring about peace in the region. And that obviously means that there has to be a cessation of these war crimes.”


McCain said a “one-time deal” won’t be productive, and only going after chemical weapons “ignores the enormity of the problem.”

“A very small percentage of the people who have been slaughtered in Syria have been slaughtered by chemical weapons,” McCain said. “It’s been done by barrel bombs and indiscriminate killing and all the other war crimes that have been committed.”

McCain's good friend Lindsey Graham already let the cat out of the bag with their real intentions, which is their desire to make this a proxy war with Iran, and for regime change in Syria.

We all know how well that worked out for us in Iraq.

We'll see how happy the isolationist who voted for Trump are if he listens to the advice of the neocons in the party.

Chris Wallace Hammers Jim Jordan: Would You Agree Clean Repeal Would Have Left Millions Without Insurance?

2017-03-26

As everyone knows by now, the so-called "Freedom Caucus," formerly known at the AstroTurf "tea party" -- a.k.a. the Koch-funded project to get the Bush stink off of the word 'Republican' -- were the ones who ended up doing the country a favor and blowing up the Zombie-Eyed Granny-Starver's (h/t Charlie Pierce) rotten debacle of an ACA "repeal and replace."

These cretins didn't like the law. Not because it was going to kill millions of Americans and leave them uninsured, but because it wasn't quite cruel enough for them. It wasn't enough to throw 24 million people off insurance; they wanted fewer children insured, fewer disabled insured, fewer chronically ill insured. And then they actually had the gall to pretend it was "Obamacare-Lite."

Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace hammered "Freedom Caucus" founder Jim Jordan over their proposal for a "clean repeal" of the Affordable Care Act, which would have left millions without health insurance, and the fact that they were never going to get any Democratic buy-in on a replacement bill.

After asking Jordan if he was willing to accept the blame for the bill going down in flames, Jordan responded there was plenty of blame to go around, since they weren't the only ones who opposed the bill. Wallace asked him about all of the concessions made to his caucus to get their support, and that's when he laid into him about the consequences if they had gotten their way:

WALLACE: OK. But wait, wait, let’s talk about this question of clean repeal. If you would have done and you could have done it, under reconciliation, there would be no ...

JORDAN: And we did 15 months ago, Chris.

WALLACE: ...There would be no subsidies to help people buy insurance or pay for their premiums or deductibles. There would be no expanded Medicaid. Let me finish. There would be no expanded Medicaid to help those people.

The result of a clean repeal is that millions of people who currently have health insurance coverage wouldn't.

JORDAN: No, the result of the claim repeal is we get rid of Obamacare.


↓ Story continues below ↓
WALLACE: Right. But that has the subsidies and has the expanded Medicaid.

JORDAN: And there would be two-year wind down, and then you replace it with things that are going to bring back affordable insurance. Again, this is just --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: The flaw with that is that to get that through, you’re going to need Democratic votes.

JORDAN: We were always going to need Democratic votes for this plan.

WALLACE: No, you weren't.

JORDAN: Look at phase two and phase three.

WALLACE: I understand. But not for the 'repeal and replace.'

(CROSSTALK)

JORDAN: We had two to ours, and ours was actually consistent with what we told the American people we were going to do.

WALLACE: Would you agree that clean repeal would have left -- just clean repeal would have left millions of people without health insurance?

JORDAN: There’s nothing that said you couldn’t start with our clean repeal bill and also put in some other things that would help. But the focus is, we want to bring back affordable insurance.

The left always defines success by signing people up for Obamacare, signing people up for Medicaid. Conservatives say, no, no, a better approach is to get back to market-oriented health care. Let’s bring down the cost of premiums so that middle-class people will be able to afford a plan in the private sector that actually fits their families needs, not a one-size-fits-all mandate from Washington. That's the difference, and that's what our plan would have accomplished.

WALLACE: The rap on the Freedom Caucus is that you refuse to take yes for an answer. The president, I don't know -- were you in the meeting on Thursday?

JORDAN: Yes.

WALLACE: So, one of the things that you guys were demanding was you wanted the essential health benefits removed, and the president agreed to remove a number of the essential health benefits, mandates on what has to be on coverage, things like maternity care, and mental health coverage. And you pocketed that and then you said, no, no, we need more, we need you to remove the protection for people with pre-existing conditions.

JORDAN: We were consistent all along. And that narrative is just not accurate. We were consistent all along. We want those regulations and mandates placed on that industry that drove up the cost of insurance. We want those to go so that premiums actually come down.

WALLACE: Wait a minute.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Wait, wait -- so you want people who have pre-existing conditions to no longer have protection?

JORDAN: No, we were talking about community rating, guaranteed issue. We wanted those revisions in that -- in those age bands, in that -- in those groups, we wanted those things remove so that you would actually bring down premiums. That’s what --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: -- bringing down premiums, if you only -- if you only insure healthy people, you’re going to have really low premiums. My point is, one of the things that you got wanted --

JORDAN: Chris, we --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Wait, wait, you wanted them to remove the provision that would protect people, that would require insurance companies to ensure people with preexisting conditions.

JORDAN: We want to remove the regulations that drive up the cost of insurance for middle-class and working-class. And we --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: -- protection for pre-existing conditions or not.

JORDAN: Even the speaker said this on Friday at his press conference, there's money in the bill to set up the high risk pools, additional dollars --

WALLACE: But you were taking away that, and you were also taking away the --

JORDAN: No, we were for that.

WALLACE: No, you were taking away the pre-existing conditions and you were also taking away --

JORDAN: We were taking away those mandates that drove up the cost.

WALLACE: Some people would look at this and say, what's good about you are going to away maternity care? You are going to take away mental health?

JORDAN: What’s good about Obamacare, which we’ve driven up the cost of insurance for every single family across the country? What’s good about that? That’s what we’re trying to change. That’s what the election about in 2010 was about, Chris, that’s what the election in 2014 and in large part, the election in November 8, 2016, was about getting rid of this law that has driven up the cost of insurance for every single working class and middle class family across this country.

That’s what we’re focused on doing. And until you go after those regulations that drive up those cost, you will not solve the problem. This bill didn’t do it. And that's why --

WALLACE: But the result is --

JORDAN: Chris, that’s why 17 -- only 17 percent of the country approved at the legislation.

WALLACE: But the result is, you've still got Obamacare. And the president offered a huge concession on Thursday on the enhanced health benefits. You wouldn't take it, you refused to vote for the bill. And the result, you cut the legs out from under President Trump and Paul Ryan on the first legislative initiative.

JORDAN: This is about the American people and what we told them we were going to do. There is no way this legislation was consistent with what the American people sent us here to accomplish. No way it was consistent with what we told them we were going to do. And that's why you saw members oppose it, and that's why the Freedom Caucus opposed it in large part because of that simple fact.

The only "freedom" these people care about is the "freedom" for insurance companies to be able to gouge their customers while they make obscene profits, their customers and the voters these Republicans are supposed to be representing be damned.

If you want to drive down the cost of insurance, you make the risk pool as large as possible, and get rid of the profit motive and keep administrative costs down. We need to move to single payer now and relegate these insurance companies to offering supplemental insurance for people who can afford it. These so-called "Freedom Caucus" members need to be exposed for being the snake oil salesmen they are.

Texas GOP Rep. Tells Raucous Crowd At A Town Hall 'You Don't Know How To Listen'

2017-03-19

Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) got an earful from the crowd when he tried to defend their ObamaCare repeal plan at a town hall in Richardson, Texas this Saturday.

Thousands of boisterous, angry North Texans on Saturday challenged Rep. Pete Sessions to stop the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

They also asked him to seriously investigate Russia's tampering in the 2016 presidential race and to squash President Donald Trump's controversial budget proposal.

But at the contentious town hall meeting at Richardson High School, a defiant Sessions stood steadfastly behind the House Republican bill to replace so-called Obamacare and said he supported much of Trump's budget, including building some sort of wall along the nation's southern border.

"I understand why you're so frustrated," Sessions said as the crowd jeered and booed his opening remarks on health care. "You don't know how to listen."

"Shut your mouth," an audience member yelled.

"We don't have to listen to your lies," one woman retorted.

Some critics were unrelenting.

"It's your job," they chanted, after Sessions wanted credit for hosting the town hall event. Read on...

Clinton won this guy's district by 48 percent, but they didn't bother to even field a candidate against him. Let's hope the Democrats finally get their act together and don't allow that to happen again in the midterm election.

Newt Gingrich Wants Republicans To Abolish The Congressional Budget Office

2017-03-14

Republicans and their dear leader Donald Trump got some bad news this Monday from the Congressional Budget office after they scored their stink-bomb of a so-called "health care" proposal, which should rightly be called a "wealth-care" bill, because it's nothing more than a massive transfer of wealth away from working people having insurance coverage to line the pockets of the rich.

They all knew this was coming and have been working to discredit the Congressional Budget Office all week, along with their Obamacare "death spiral" they love to repeat ad nauseum.

Former disgraced House Speaker, Fox regular and grifter king Newt Gingrich was out making the rounds doing damage control for Trump and his buddies in Congress, and decided to take it a step further, and called for the CBO to be abolished altogether:

Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) slammed the Congressional Budget Office, which released a critical score of the Republicans' ObamaCare replacement bill, declaring that it should be abolished.

On "The First 100 Days," Martha MacCallum asked Gingrich what he thought of the CBO's scoring, which said 14 million more people will be uninsured by 2018 under the plan championed by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).

"They should abolish the Congressional Budget Office," Gingrich said. "It is corrupt, it is dishonest, it was totally wrong on ObamaCare by huge, huge margins."

Gingrich said he does not believe a single word they print in their reports.

He said, as House Speaker in the 1990s, he balanced the federal budget for four straight years, and "fought the CBO every time."

Gingrich said the organization, billed as a nonpartisan scorekeeper for legislation, used an ObamaCare architect to help score the Affordable Care Act.

"[They're] totally dishonest, disgustingly wrong," he said. "That whole thing should be abolished."

We all know Trump gets all of his "news" from watching Fox, so we'll see how long it takes for him to be repeating Gingrich's demand. Never mind the fact that Trump loved the CBO back when it fit his narrative and he was using their numbers to bash Obamacare:

Chris Wallace Slams Priebus For Attacking The Media: 'You Don't Get To Tell Us What To Do Reince!'

2017-02-20

You know things are bad when your administration's attacks on the press are so rotten, even Fox's Chris Wallace starts sounding like a journalist. If RNCPRBS was expecting a cushy interview from the usually friendly territory of Fox "news" this Sunday morning, he was in for an unpleasant surprise.

White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus got more than he bargained for when he tried telling the host of Fox News Sunday how to do his job in response to Wallace's questions about the Trump administration's attacks on the media and press freedom and his labeling of the media as an "enemy" of the American people.

WALLACE: President Trump is punching back against critics especially in the media who say after just 30 days in office his administration has gone off the tracks. He made his case this week in an extraordinary news conference, and then yesterday in Florida in a campaign-style rally.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: We are here today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I hear your demands, I hear your voices, and I promise you that I will deliver. I promise that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Joining us now from Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach is White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.

Reince, I want to start with President Trump’s --

REINCE PRIEBUS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Good morning, Chris.

WALLACE: -- tweet on Friday afternoon. This is what he wrote, "The fake news media (failing New York Times, NBC News, ABC, CBS, CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American people."

Reince, the president believes that a free and independent press is a threat to the country?

PRIEBUS: No, I think -- I think for the most part -- and I understand where he’s coming from -- is that there are certain things that are happening in the news that just aren’t honest. And we’re not talking about everyone, Chris. We’re not talking about all news, but we’re talking about something that I guess he’s termed as fake news.


↓ Story continues below ↓
Let me give you an example. First of all, The New York Times put out an article with no direct sources that said that the Trump campaign had constant contacts with Russian spies, basically, you know, some treasonous type of accusations. We have now all kinds of people looking into this. I can assure you and I have been approved to say this -- that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured me that that story is not only inaccurate, but it’s grossly overstated and it was wrong. And there’s nothing to it.

And so, if I can say that to the American people, then what does it say about the story?

The next day, Chris. The Wall Street Journal puts out a story that says that they have anonymous sources that say that the intelligence community is purposefully cutting out material from President Trump's briefing material that he gets everyday. That then proved to be untrue. All of the agencies put out a statement saying it was totally inaccurate.

Then, we get --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Reince, I get the fact that you don’t like -- I get the fact that you don’t like some stories. First of all, you made some news there at the top and I want to a follow up on that.

You say, because you’ve said before, you weren’t part of the campaign, so you cannot speak to that. You say that the intelligence community says that there were no contacts between anyone in the Trump campaign, any associate of Mr. Trump and anybody involved as a Russian agent as to the campaign and collusion in the campaign with Russia? Is that what you're saying?

PRIEBUS: Yes, they’ve told me -- absolutely. They have made it very clear that that story in The New York Times is complete garbage. And, quite frankly, they use different words than that, OK?

WALLACE: Who is it that said that?

PRIEBUS: And then when I read back --

WALLACE: Who is it that said that?

PRIEBUS: I’m not going to tell you. I can’t tell you that.

WALLACE: Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Reince. You just complained about unnamed sources, you are using an unnamed source.

PRIEBUS: Well, because I didn’t ask for approval to use their name. But I will tell you this, when I say top level people, I mean top level people, OK?

WALLACE: So, no collusion whatsoever between anybody involved with Trump and anybody involved with Russia in the 2016 campaign?

PRIEBUS: No. And if you look at Devin Nunes’ comments in the actual paper on the record, Chris --

WALLACE: Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

PRIEBUS: He was briefed by the FBI. And what did he do? He turned around and went on the record and said that this story is complete garbage, OK? So, here we are --

WALLACE: Here's the problem. Reince, wait a minute, here’s the problem -- I don’t have any problem with you complaining about an individual story. We sometimes got it wrong, you guys sometimes got it wrong. I don't have any problem with you complaining about bias.

But you went a lot further than that, or to the president went a lot further than that. He said that the fake media, not certain stories, the fake media are an enemy to the country. We don’t have a state-run media in the country. That's what they have in dictatorships.

PRIEBUS: OK, listen, Chris, it’s not just two stories. Then, it’s followed up by 24 hours a day, seven days a week of other cable stations, not necessarily FOX, that all day long on every Chyron, every seven minutes are talking about the Russian spies, talking about the intelligence community, talking about how me and Steve Bannon don’t like each other, and what’s Kellyanne doing? All this is just total garbage, unsourced stuff.

Listen, there is nothing wrong with background. Reporters need background information. We need to communicate with reporters and give reporters context.

All I’m saying, though, is if you are going to come out with this -- if you’re going to come out with this story that says Russian spies are talking to your campaign, my God -- I mean, you actually -- I think that you should in some cases or in most cases actually have a named source.

Look what we’ve done. We’ve repealed TPP. We have signed a coal bill to save the coal industry. We named Neil Gorsuch. We de -- put a --

WALLACE: And you know what, Reince?

(CROSSTALK)

PRIEBUS: -- to deregulate the federal government.

WALLACE: Wait a minute, we and all of the other cable channels have covered live the announcement of Neil Gorsuch.

PRIEBUS: Right.

WALLACE: We have covered live a lot of these other events. We have covered live an hour and 15 minutes the president’s news conference.

PRIEBUS: Hiring freeze --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Here’s the problem, when the president says we’re the enemy of the American people, it makes it sounds like if you are going against him, you are going against the country.

PRIEBUS: Here is the problem, Chris -- the problem is you’re right. Some of these things were covered, but you get about 10 percent coverage on the fact that you get a very successful meeting with Bibi Netanyahu, the prime minister of the U.K., the prime minister of Canada --

WALLACE: We covered all of those news conference live. Everybody did.

PRIEBUS: Right. Sure, yes, for about -- yes, right. But then as soon as it was over, the next 20 hours is all about Russian spies --

WALLACE: But you don’t get to tell us what to do, Reince.

(CROSSTALK)

PRIEBUS: -- nothing is happening. Give me a break.

WALLACE: You don’t get to tell us what to do any more than Barack Obama did. Barack Obama whined about Fox News all the time, but I got to say, he never said that we were an enemy of the people.

PRIEBUS: Let me tell you something, he said a lot of things about Fox News, Chris. I thought you ought to go check the tape. He blamed you for a lot of things. And I’m surprised, as someone from Fox, that you forget all of the shots that he took --

WALLACE: No, he took the shots. And we didn't like it. And, frankly, we don't like this either, because, you know -- but he never went as far as President Trump has and that’s what’s concerning because it seems like he crosses a line when he talks about that we’re an enemy of the people. That is concerning.

PRIEBUS: I think you should be concerned -- I think you should be concerned about mainstream news outlets that are acting like, you know, Washington daily gossip magazines instead of the way it used to be where you would get a few sources on the record -- yes, you will need some background, and maybe, yes, you will need some anonymous sources.

But to accuse an organization of being in constant contact with Russian spies is outrageous. Every day, it’s something different. It’s some other source that is absolutely untrue. Instead of talking about the things that are going on --

WALLACE: All right. Can I ask you about --

PRIEBUS: -- that you’re doing every single day.

McCain And Graham Announce Support For Former Exxon CEO Tillerson

2017-01-22

If anyone was holding out hope that Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham were going to be the ones to save us from the former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson being confirmed as Secretary of State, those hopes were dashed this weekend:

Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsay Graham (R-SC) announced Sunday they will vote to confirm Rex Tillerson to be Trump’s Secretary of StateThe confirmation of the former ExxonMobil CEO is now all but certain. At least three GOP senators were needed to kill the nomination, and it’s not clear who among the Republicans besides Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) remains as a possible “no” vote.In their joint statement, McCain and Graham said they were supporting Tillerson even though “we still have concerns about his past dealings with the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin.”

Bizarrely, the statement actually explains why they should have voted no:
“Now more than ever, with America’s friends growing more discouraged and our enemies growing more emboldened, we need a Secretary of State who recognizes that our nation cannot succeed in the world by itself.”

What exactly could discourage our friends and embolden our enemies more than handing over U.S. foreign policy to a pal of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who may have worked to undermine the U.S. election? Read on...

This Week host George Stephanopoulos asked McCain about his decision and McCain told him it was a "tough call" but in the end, he decided it was best to give Trump "the benefit of the doubt." Trump shouldn't be trusted any further than someone could throw him, but you're never going to see any of these Republicans stand up to someone in their own party.

Transcript via ABC:

STEPHANOPOULOS: When you mentioned the president's national security team, you didn't mention his nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson.

Have you decided how you're going to vote on his nomination?


↓ Story continues below ↓
MCCAIN: I will be voting in favor of his nomination. I have had numerous conversations with him. And, again, my concerns have been about our relations with Russia. And his past relations, I believe -- and I’m very cautious about this -- but I believe that Mr. Tillerson understands the importance of a steadfast and strong relationship --

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: How did he assure you?

MCCAIN: Well, he talked to me a lot about his views about Russia, about the events that have taken place, about the fact of what his duties were as a head of one of the world's largest corporations.

Listen, this wasn't an easy call. But I also believe that, when there's doubt, the president, the incoming president, gets the benefit of the doubt. And that's the way I have treated every president that I have had the obligation to vote for or against as a member of the United States Senate.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And on the issue of Russia, are you confident that all these investigation, the investigations by the intelligence agencies now, the investigation by the FBI, the congressional investigations, are going to get to the bottom of what happened in this election?

MCCAIN: It may. But the best way to do it is with a select committee or a select -- or a commission.

What the Russians did was imperil the very fundamental of a democracy and that is to affect the election. I don’t believe there is any evidence that they did. But the attempt was very sophisticated. The attempt was much more far-reaching than we had ever anticipated.

And so there has to be a full and complete investigation. And that should guide our relations to a large degree with Russia.
