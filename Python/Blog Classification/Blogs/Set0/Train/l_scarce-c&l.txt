McCain Snaps At Fox News Reporter

2017-10-18

When asked about his relationship with Trump, McCain snapped, “Why would you say something that stupid? Why would you ask something that dumb?”

Umm...because Peter Doocy (Steve's kid) works at Fox News?

DOOCY: "Has your relationship with the president frayed to the point that you are not going to support anything that he comes and asks you for?"

McCAIN: “Why would you say something that stupid? Why would you ask something that dumb?”

“My job as a United States senator — you mean I am somehow going to behave in a way that I’m going to block everything because of some personal disagreement?” McCain said incredulously. “That’s a dumb question.”

'Spooktacular Halloween' Party At Fort Bragg Draws Criticism

2017-10-16

Apparently this was the image chosen to advertise a children's Halloween party at Fort Bragg, I can't imagine why little white kids in blackface as 'darkie' minstrels manipulated on strings by a white woman would cause offense, can you?

The image shows a puppeteer appearing to manipulate two children posing as puppets wearing black face makeup. The picture was used to promote a "Spooktacular Halloween party" set to happen later this month. The caption on the Facebook post urged those attending to get their costumes ready.

"It's sending the wrong message to kids," said another local, James Pearson. "White people control black people, you know? That's the way I perceive it."

Fort Bragg's MWR Facebook page has since taken the photo down. It issued an apology saying the photo should not have been posted and does not represent the views of its organization.

Despite that apology, the Bingham family finds the post offensive and continues questioning why it happened.

"How can you expect us to want to support this installation and organization when you have no respect for our people?" asked Tammi Bingham.

"The blame lies right at the doorstep at the White House". Succinct and to the point.

"Look at the campaign he ran," Signer said on CNN's "State of the Union."
Signer called on everyone to join together to recognize and combat racism, adding that the effort should include Trump.

Trump Booster Struggles To Name 'Wins'

2017-07-19

Arizona's Kelli Ward is a big Trump supporter. She's one of those Tea Party darlins' that have so polluted the political landscape in recent years. And she'd like nothing more than to rid Arizona of one its two establishment Republican senators, either John McCain or Jeff Flake. So when she gets the chance to go to DC or appear on CNN (mostly to slam Flake) she jumps at it.

If her appearance on CNN yesterday was any indication though, she's just not ready for the big leagues. The "curveball" of naming a single legislative accomplishment just too much for the poor dear.

“If you’re disappointed that issues haven’t brought about a win in terms of repeal and replace, are you disappointed in the president at all?” Baldwin asked.

“No, I think the president has done a great job,” Ward demurred. “He’s stayed on track, he’s encouraged the House and Senate to do what needs to be done.”

“With all due respect,” Baldwin said, “other than Justice Gorsuch, what is the president’s biggest win so far?”

“Justice Gorsuch is the biggest win so far, but there are a list of accomplishments like you cannot believe that Donald Trump has done. I mean I think that his executive travel order is also a win because he wants to keep America safe.”

Kevin O'Leary Drops Out Of Conservative Leadership Race

2017-04-16

Reality tv star (ABC's Shark Tank) and businessman Kevin O'Leary threw in the towel today to become leader of Canada's Conservative Party, with the sudden epiphany that the ability to speak French in a bilingual nation might be an asset for a Prime Minister.

Kevin O'Leary is dropping out of the Conservative leadership race and endorsing Maxime Bernier.

The businessman and reality TV star is ending his campaign only hours before the last leadership debate in Toronto, and two days before party members can start casting their votes. O'Leary's name will remain on the ballots as they've already been printed and mailed, the party said.

O'Leary said Wednesday he was confident he could win the Conservative race, but raised doubts he could defeat Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the next election. He cited his failure to gain traction in Quebec and his poor French-language skills as reasons for dropping out of the leadership race.

"The Liberals politically own Quebec. Without growing the Conservative base in Quebec, beating Trudeau in 2019 would be a huge challenge," O'Leary said at press conference with reporters in Toronto.

"It would seem foolish, even selfish, to win the leadership knowing I don't have the path, a high probability [of winning the next federal election]. The likelihood of me gaining a lot of seats in Quebec was low. I was weak in Quebec, it's a fact, people know this."

O'Leary said Bernier was best placed to pick up seats for the party in the province. "Look at how many times Quebec has determined the federal outcomes. It is the Florida of Canada, it often decides for the country.

'Even Canadians Are Skipping Trips To America After Trump Travel Ban'

2017-04-15

A story in the Washington Post details the devastating effects on tourism from Trump's proposed travel ban. An Industry analytics firm pegs the losses at $7.4bil in 2017, and $10.8bil next year. Demand is down across the board, including from Canada, usually a reliable source of tourism but not anymore. The lone exception? Travel from Russia, where inquiries are up 60%.

Source: Washington Post

The cancellations came quickly and in rapid succession. Within days of President Trump’s first executive order restricting travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, a number of European travel groups pulled their plans, amounting to a loss of 2,000 overnight stays for Hostelling International USA.

The ban would complicate travel for citizens of the countries cited — among them Iran, Syria and Libya. But Canadians and Europeans and others were dropping their plans, too. As group organizers put it, people suddenly had an unsettling sense that the United States wasn’t as welcoming a place as it once was.

The result was a wave of withdrawals. “Getting those cancellations all at once, that was startling,” said Russ Hedge, chief executive of HIU, which oversees 52 hostels across the country. “We’ve never seen something like that.”
...
Demand for flights to the United States has fallen in nearly every country since January, ­according to Hopper, a travel-booking app that analyzes more than 10 billion daily airfare price quotes to derive its data. Searches for U.S. flights from China and Iraq have dropped 40 percent since Trump’s inauguration, while demand in Ireland and New Zealand is down about 35 percent. (One exception: Russia, where searches for flights to the United States have surged 60 percent since January.)

The result could be an estimated 4.3 million fewer people coming to the United States this year, resulting in $7.4 billion in lost revenue, according to Tourism Economics, a Philadelphia-based analytics firm. Next year, the fallout is expected to be even larger, with 6.3 million fewer tourists and $10.8 billion in losses. Miami is expected to be hit hardest, followed by San Francisco and New York, the firm said.       



The administration’s travel ban deals a blow to an industry that has only recently recovered from a $600 billion loss following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Louis C.K. Opines On Trump: ‘He’s Just A Lying Sack Of Sh*t’

2017-04-15

New Yorkers long ago sized Trump up for what he is: a bullshitter. Why much of the rest of the country overlooked the obvious remains a complete and utter mystery.

Source: The Hill

In an interview with Stephen Colbert on Tuesday night's episode of "Late Show," C.K. ranted about various types of liars. The show tweeted out a clip with the caption "Tune in tonight to hear #LouisCK explain what type of liar our President is."

"Someones people lie - 'That guy lied, they found out he lied.' Then there’s somebody who lies because they can’t quite stay inside the boundaries of truth," he began.

"Then you have a liar, somebody who it’s almost like a problem, they lie a lot.

"Then you have a lying sack of s—t,” he said to applause from the audience, referring to the president. "That’s somebody who just they just lie, they like it — he likes it. He goes, ‘Heh heh, it wasn’t even true. Wasn’t even true. Then I said ‘they were liars.'"

"It’s just an insane. It’s just gross. He’s just a gross, crook, dirty, rotten, lying sack of s--t,” the comedian said.

Colbert pointed to someone in his audience: “Louis, there’s a guy who voted for him up there."

C.K. said it was the voters who were the "victims of the lying."

"Look if you voted, that’s the guy he lied to," he said. "He didn’t lie to me. He lied to him. He didn’t lie to me. Everybody else was like ‘yeah, no that’s not true.' But that guy bought it. "

Stephen Miller Repeats Trump's Lies About Massive Voter Fraud

2017-02-12

Trump's Senior White House Advisor, Stephen Miller, has proven to be as capable and unabashed as Dear Leader at providing blatant lies to an incredulous press.

Stephanopoulos, by my reckoning, asked for evidence to back Miller's claims no less than eight times in less than four minutes. Miller ignored him. "We'll get back to you on that if you like, George," more or less paraphrasing his bullshit reply.

They lie because they know they can get away with it.

Even the ex-GOP leader in New Hampshire has called them liars, and was willing to wager $1000 on their claims.

Transcript:

STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me move on, though, to the question of voter fraud as well. President Trump again this week suggested in a meeting with senators that thousands of illegal voters were bused from Massachusetts to New Hampshire and that’s what caused his defeat in the state of New Hampshire, also the defeat of Senator Kelly Ayotte.

That has provoked a response from a member of the Federal Election Commission, Ellen Weintraub, who says I call upon the president to immediately share New Hampshire voter fraud evidence so that his allegations may be investigated promptly.

Do you have that evidence?

MILLER: I’ve actually, having worked before on a campaign in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters in to New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who’s worked in New Hampshire politics. It’s very real, it’s very serious. This morning on this show is not the venue for me lay out all the evidence, but I can tell you this. Voter fraud is a serious problem in this country. You have millions of people who are registered in two states, who are dead who are registered to vote, and you have 14 percent of non-citizens, according to academic research, at a minimum, are registered to vote. Which is an astonishing statistic. [Ed. The research was refuted years ago, because of data inaccuracies. Link.]


↓ Story continues below ↓
STEPHANOPOULOS: You can’t -- hold on a second. You just claimed again that there was illegal voting in New Hampshire, people bused in from the state of Massachusetts. Do you have evidence of that?

MILLER: I’m saying anybody -- George, go to New Hampshire. Talk to anybody who’s worked in politics there for a long time. Everybody’s aware of the problem in New Hampshire with respect to --

STEPHANOPOULOS: I’m asking you, the White House Senior --

(CROSSTALK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Hold a second. I’m asking you as the White House senior policy adviser, the president made a statement saying he was the victim of voter fraud.

MILLER: And the president --

(CROSSTALK)

MILLER: And the president was!

STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you have any evidence?

MILLER: If this is an issue that interests you, then we can talk about it more in the future and we now have our government beginning to get stood up, but we have a Department of Justice and we have more officials. An issue of voter fraud, someone is going to be looking at very seriously and very hard. But the reality is, is that we know for a fact -- you have maps of numbers of non-citizens registered to vote in this country. Nobody disputes that. And many, many highly qualified people like Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, have looked deeply into this issue and have confirmed it to be true. And have put together evidence. And I suggest you invite Kris Kobach onto your show and he can walk you through some of the evidence of voter fraud --

STEPHANOPOULOS: You --

MILLER: -- in greater detail.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Just for the record, you have provided absolutely no evidence. The president’s made a statement --

MILLER: The White House has provided enormous evidence with respect to voter fraud, with respect to people being registered in more than one state. Dead people voting, non-citizens being registered to vote. George, it is a fact and you will not deny it that are massive numbers of non-citizens in this country who are registered to vote. That is a scandal! We should stop the presses and as a country we should be aghast about the fact that you have people who have no right to vote in this country registered to vote, canceling out the franchise of lawful citizens of this country. That’s the story we should be talking about! And I’m prepared to go on any show, anywhere, any time, and repeat it and say the President of the United States is correct, 100 percent.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You just repeated that you just made those declarations, but for the record you’ve provided zero evidence that the president was the victim of massive voter fraud in New Hampshire. You provided zero evidence --

MILLER: Anyone who’s in New Hampshire politics --

STEPHANOPOULOS: Hold on.

MILLER: -- is familiar with that issue.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You have provided zero evidence of the president’s claim that he would’ve won the general -- the popular vote if 3 to 5 million illegal immigrants hadn’t voted. Zero evidence for either one of those claims.

MILLER: Well, if you -- it’s --

STEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks a lot for joining us in the morning (ph).

MILLER: The non-citizen voting issue -- the non-citizen voting issue is pervasive and widespread and we are going to protect our country from voter fraud. We’re going to protect our borders from terrorism. And we’re going to protect innocent men, women, and children from violent criminal illegal immigrants that need to be removed from this country. And our country will create jobs, safety, prosperity, and security -- particularly for disenfranchised working people of every background, faith, and ethnicity in this country.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You can start by providing evidence to back up your claims.

Thanks for joining us this morning.

MILLER: Thank you.

Vote Vets Debuts Powerful Ad That Shames Trump

2017-02-06

Simple, straightforward, and powerful. Act Like One has since gone viral.

Source: Refinery 29

Donald Trump doesn't have the best record on the military. You'll recall that he used a veterans event to call a journalist a sleaze, lied about the size of his donation to a veterans charity, and bashed a Gold Star family using racist and Islamophobic rhetoric. Yesterday, he went on The O'Reilly Factor and compared America's troops to Vladimir Putin, drawing the ire of at least one retired general. Today, he used a luncheon at CENTCOM to tell troops about his buddy Tom Brady's (admittedly incredible) Super Bowl victory. That was after he used his speech to once again tout his historically narrow election victory.

So it should come as little surprise that a veterans group created this now-viral ad calling on the Commander in Chief to do better on our men and women in uniform. VoteVets will debut this ad on Morning Joe, part of Donald Trump's unhealthy diet of cable news.

Trump's First Military Operation Goes Disastrously Wrong

2017-02-02

Two Americans, including a Navy SEAL and an 8-year-old girl were left dead. Three other SEALs were left seriously injured. At least thirty Yemenis were killed, and much of a village left destroyed.

Source: NBC News

In what an official said was the first military raid carried out under President Donald Trump, two Americans were killed in Yemen on Sunday — one a member of SEAL Team 6 and the other the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the New Mexico-born al Qaeda leader who himself was killed in a U.S. strike five years ago.

The raid in southern Yemen, conducted by the supersecret Joint Special Operations Command, was intended to capture valuable intelligence, specifically computer equipment, according to a senior U.S. military official. Three al Qaeda leaders were killed, according to U.S. officials.

Contrary to earlier reporting, the senior military official said, the raid was Trump's first clandestine strike — not a holdover mission approved by President Barack Obama. The mission involved "boots on the ground" at an al Qaeda camp near al Bayda in south central Yemen, the official said.

"Almost everything went wrong," the official said.

An MV-22 Osprey experienced a hard landing near the site, injuring several SEALs, one severely. The tilt-rotor aircraft had to be destroyed. A SEAL was killed during the firefight on the ground, as were some noncombatants, including females.

Further details have emerged of just how bad this was mishandled, raising questions whether it should have ever been initiated, or called off when the Americans lost the element of surprise.

(Reuters) U.S. military officials told Reuters that Trump approved his first covert counterterrorism operation without sufficient intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations.

As a result, three officials said, the attacking SEAL team found itself dropping onto a reinforced al Qaeda base defended by landmines, snipers, and a larger than expected contingent of heavily armed Islamist extremists.
....
The military officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said "a brutal firefight" killed Owens and at least 15 Yemeni women and children. One of the dead was the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a militant killed by a 2011 U.S. drone strike.

And of course declared a resounding success by this misAdministration.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday the raid yielded benefits.

"Knowing that we killed an estimated 14 AQAP members and that we gathered an unbelievable amount of intelligence that will prevent the potential deaths or attacks on American soil – is something that I think most service members understand, that that’s why they joined the service,” Spicer said.

In an interview with The Guardian, the girl's grandfather said he didn't think her death was intentional.

In an interview with the Guardian, the girl’s grandfather, Nasser al-Awlaki, said he did not believe the Americans meant to kill his granddaughter. Nawar, who was staying at the house with her mother, was shot in the neck and died two hours later.

“I don’t think this incident was intentional,” Nasser al-Awlaki said in a phone interview from Yemen.

The elder Awlaki, a former government minister, said the village in which his granddaughter was staying was not an AQAP hotbed, but rather home to her uncles, tribal sheikhs who were actually fighting with the legal government of Yemen, which the ruling Iran-backed Houthi movement ousted in a coup.

Awlaki said the exiled former government was sending arms to his relatives from its southern stronghold in Aden, to combat the Houthis.

“If the Americans assumed that those arms were going to the hands of al-Qaida or something, I don’t know,” Nasser al-Awlaki said. “I cannot understand why the Americans use this big commando strike, which is similar to what happened to Osama bin Laden, in a small village in Yemen.”
