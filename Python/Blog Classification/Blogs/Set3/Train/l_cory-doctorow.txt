Roy Moore's scandal is just the tip of American evangelical Christianity's child bride problem

2017-11-12

When Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore was accused of sexually molesting children as young as 14, his fellow hardcore evangelicals shrugged at the scandal -- it was "common knowledge" that Moore had a fondness for young teens.

Moore isn't alone in liking very young girls as sexual partners. The grooming of children to marry adult men is a common practice in American evangelical circles, and infamous child-bride advocates are celebrated on the lecture circuit, especially among home schoolers.

These "courting" experts counsel parents to encourage their children to seek marriage with adult men, advocating for marriage in the "middle-teens."

It's a widespread view among the hard right evangelical world, mainstream enough that Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson has publicly advised his fans to marry 15- or 16-year-old girls, because "you wait until they get to be 20 years old, the only picking that's going to take place is your pocket." This view was defended by mainstream Republicans, and Robertson has continued to enjoy success in right-wing media, with a new show on CRTV.

Predictably, adult men who are caught having sex with children blame the children for "seducing" them, and in the Independent Fundamentalist Baptist sect, these children are forced to repent for having "sinned" by tempting adults to commit statutory rape, making public confessions to their congregations.

As a teenager, I attended a lecture on courtship by a home-school speaker who was popular at the time. He praised the idea of "early courtship" so the girl could be molded into the best possible helpmeet for her future husband. The girl's father was expected to direct her education after the courtship began so she could help her future husband in his work.

In retrospect, I understand what the speaker was really describing: Adult men selecting and grooming girls who were too young to have life experience. Another word for that is "predation."

Much of the sexual abuse that takes place in Independent Fundamentalist Baptist, or IFB, churches involves adult men targeting 14- to 16-year-old girls. If caught, the teenage victim may be forced to repent the "sin" of having seduced an adult man. Former IFB megachurch pastor Jack Schaap argued that he should be released from prison after being convicted of molesting a 16-year-old girl, asserting that the "aggressiveness" of his victim "inhibited [his] impulse control." In the wake of the Schaap case, numerous other stories emerged of sexual abuse cover-ups involving teenage girls at IFB churches. In another high-profile case, pregnant 15-year-old Tina Anderson, who was raped by a church deacon twice her age, was forced to confess her "sin" to the congregation.

Paradise Papers reveal cozy relationship between Stubhub and Canadian botmaster/scalper kingpin

2017-11-11

The Paradise Papers continue to expose the economically useless activity that late-stage capitalism rewards with titanic sums of money: today, it's the story of Julien Lavallée, a botmaster ticket-scalper who has harvested the lion's share of concert tickets from all over the world, laundering them for millions through a secret "top seller" program that Stubhub offers to anyone who can move more than $50,000 worth of tickets per year.

Though virtually all the territories in which Lavallée operates ban bots from raiding ticket-sales, and even criminalize actions like lying to make your business appear to be a person looking for tickets, Lavallée takes advantage of the ambiguous way that these laws operate on out-of-country purchasers to gross millions ($7.9 million in 2016 accounted for in the Paradise Papers).

So while the UK criminalizes masquerading as a regular ticket-purchaser, it can't reach to Canada where Lavallée operates. And while Canada has stiff penalties for essential elements of the scalper's playbook, it doesn't penalize Canadians who break those rules in the UK.

Lavallée is described by unnamed Stubhub employees as "one of their biggest global resellers."

Lavallée's affairs are hard to unravel, but they're full of sketchy-as-hell alarm bells, like the company registered to an address in the Isle of Man, a UK tax haven --- no one at that address had heard of the company, and the day after the CBC knocked on the door, Lavallée closed the company down.

Ticket scalping is almost a perfect parody of finance shenanigans, the kind of economically useless activity that masquerades as "liquidity provision" or "arbitrage" on Wall Street and in the City of London. It's a kind of microcosm of how finance rigs the system: people who want to do something in the "real economy" (see a concert) get fleeced by people who use high-speed trading algorithms to snatch the necessary elements of this economic activity out from under them, extracting several multiples of the asset-price from them, and neither the buyer nor the original seller (the performers) get a penny from it. Both the buyer and seller have to live in the real economy, where the money they spend and earn is taxed, while the much larger sums extracted by the useless middle-men are squirreled away offshore and tax-free. Squint a little and you've got the whole late-stage capitalist economy in a snowglobe miniature, begging to be smashed to the pavement.

Lavallée, his wife and father, who work together in the business, all declined to answer questions.

In an emailed statement, his lawyer said Ticketaria "carries out all its activities in accordance with the laws and rules of the jurisdictions in which it operates and sells."

At anti-monopoly event, Al Franken blasts big tech

2017-11-09

Al Franken's speech on big tech and its surveillance, influence, opacity and high-handedness sometimes lacked coherence (you can't call for "Net Neutrality principles" for Amazon, Google, and Facebook and ask them to police bad speech, propaganda, etc), but the important thing is where he gave that speech.

Franken spoke at an event hosted by the Open Markets Institute, a fearless anti-monopoly thinktank that was expelled from the New America Foundation after they praised the EU's antitrust settlement against Google and Google cut off funding to New America in retaliation.

Technology has many sins to answer for, starting with the list of horrors that Franken spelled out, but these are problems, largely, of monopolism. Tech grew up in the era of financial ascendancy, in which shareholder considerations and casino-style IPO payouts were the main feature of the business world; and tech came of age in the era of monopoly, when Chicago School-influenced regulators stopped prosecuting any kind of anti-competitive conduct or mergers, save those that raised prices -- leaving intact the kinds of commercial activity that reduced competition, choice, and the power of other entities in the ecosystem, from workers to suppliers to retailers.

Too often, "technology critics" mistake correlation for causation. They blame search engines and social media for our ills -- not financialized, unchecked, rapacious search engine and social media companies, driven by global capital, serviced by tax-havens, encouraged by policymakers.

So Franken doesn't quite have a handle on what tech companies should and should not do, and that means he needs to be educated on this -- the important thing is that he's locating his criticism exactly where it belongs: in the unchecked, winner-take-all system of neoliberal, unchecked capitalism.

Franken’s proposed solution to tech’s power? More hearings, investigations, and perhaps rules that would require Google and Facebook, in particular, not to discriminate in the content they distribute, much as internet providers may not favor some content over others under so-called net-neutrality rules. “As tech giants become a new kind of internet gatekeeper, I believe the same basic principles of net neutrality should apply here,” said Franken. “No one company should have the power to pick and choose which content reaches consumers and which doesn’t,” he said. “Facebook, Google, and Amazon, like ISPs, should be neutral in their treatment of the flow of lawful information and commerce on their platform.”
