Roy Moore is fundraising from 'God-fearing conservatives' in response to report he preyed on teens

2017-11-09

What’s an uber-conservative God-fearing Republican politician to do faced with careful, detailed reporting that, as a man in his 30s, he abused his position as an assistant district attorney to prey on teenage girls? If you’re Alabama’s Roy Moore, you fundraise off of it. That’s right, Moore is out with a fundraising email claiming that “The Obama-Clinton Machine’s liberal media lapdogs just launched the most vicious and nasty round of attacks against me I’ve EVER faced.”

Mind you, those “vicious and nasty attacks” are reporting with allegations from four separate women who don’t know one another, and in the most serious case corroboration from two people the woman—then a 14-year-old girl—told at the time. That’s what Roy Moore wants “God-fearing conservatives like you” to give him money to defend against.

Steve King takes a break from immigrant-bashing to push abortion ban at six weeks

2017-10-27

Rep. Steve King has two major obsessions: immigration and abortion. Maybe thinking that Donald Trump is doing enough on the being-horrible-to-immigrants front, this week the Iowa Republican has turned his attention to abortion, introducing a bill to ban abortions as soon as a heartbeat can be detected, as early as six weeks into pregnancy, a time when many women don’t yet know they’re pregnant. If this bill became law, getting an abortion would essentially require a woman to take a pregnancy test 10 minutes after her period was late and make an immediate phone call for an appointment to terminate the pregnancy. Unless there were drop-in clinic appointments available so that women who took a pregnancy test an entire week later could get same-day service. Apparently King wants women making hasty choices.

Science lesson: week six of pregnancy is actually week four post-conception. Here’s the American Pregnancy Association on a six-week embryo:

Between 5 ½ to 6 ½ weeks, a fetal pole or even a fetal heartbeat may be detected by vaginal ultrasound.  The fetal pole is the first visible sign of a developing embryo. This pole structure actually has some curve to it with the embryo’s head at one end and what looks like a tail at the other end.

The fetal pole now allows for crown to rump measurements (CRL) to be taken, so that pregnancy dating can be a bit more accurate. The fetal pole may be seen at a crown-rump length (CRL) of 2-4mm, and the heartbeat may be seen as a regular flutter when the CRL has reached 5mm.
Just FYI. The baby has a heartbeat! Yeah, and a tail. In those fruit and vegetable comparisons that pregnant women are always getting, six weeks is a lentil or a pomegranate seed.

What’s likely is not that King seriously thinks a six-week ban will be passed into law and upheld by the courts. Rather, he’s trying to follow the route Ohio Gov. John Kasich took in late 2016, using the threat of a six-week ban to make a still-unconstitutional 20-week ban seem like a reprieve—and possibly get the Trump-era Supreme Court to reconsider the constitutionality of 20-week abortion bans.

King’s bill will get a subcommittee hearing on November 1. It will be as outrageous an assault on women’s right to control their own bodies as it is now and as it will be in 100 years.

CHIP may finally get a vote, but Republicans want to blame Democrats for the delay

2017-10-26

It’s been 26 days since the Children’s Health Insurance Program expired, states are running low on funding and trying to figure out when to let parents know that their kids will be losing health insurance … and House Republicans are blaming Democrats for the delay. Republicans have proposed a series of poison pills for funding CHIP, so now they say everything is the Democrats’ fault for fighting that:

Democrats took issue with offsets that would cut funding to ObamaCare's public health fund and charge higher premiums to Medicare beneficiaries earning more than $500,000 a year.

The bill would also cut the grace period for ObamaCare enrollees who fail to make premium payments.
Gee, what a mystery why Democrats would oppose paying for health coverage for kids by cutting a public health fund. According to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Democrats just keep delaying (in order to push for clean funding), but in the Senate, Democrats are pushing hard for a vote and reminding us what’s going on here.

Virginia Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine have sent Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a letter urging a vote. “​​​​​​There has always been a bipartisan consensus on the importance of reauthorizing CHIP, and this year is no different,” they write. Significantly, they go on to urge McConnell “to bring a bill to the floor quickly that includes pay-fors that are acceptable to both sides.” And that’s the hold-up. Republicans would claim Democrats were being unreasonable if they opposed a Republican-proposed pay-for of selling the blood of puppies and kittens to the Koch brothers as a youth tonic. Meanwhile, nearly 9 million children are being left hanging while Republicans try to gut a public health fund in their names.

Republican establishment climbs into bed with fire-breathing bigot Roy Moore

2017-10-26

Roy Moore, the notoriously bigoted Alabama judge and now Republican Senate nominee, may be running as an anti-establishment candidate who took down the establishment pick in a primary. But that doesn’t mean he and establishment Republicans won’t happily hop into bed together, as long as it’s a metaphorical campaign bed. On Tuesday, Moore’s campaign signed a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee, National Republican Senatorial Committee, and the Alabama Republican Party. On Wednesday, Texas Sen. John Cornyn endorsed Moore; Cornyn is the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, behind Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Let’s take a look at who the Republican Party and a member of its Senate leadership are rallying behind, shall we?

Roy Moore has called the Supreme Court decision making marriage equality the law of the land “even worse in a sense” than the Dred Scott decision upholding slavery, and was removed from office as a judge for ordering probate judges to deny gay couples marriage licenses.

Moore fought to keep segregation in the Alabama state constitution—in 2004.

Moore said that little children were killed in Newtown “because we’ve forgotten the law of God.” It wasn’t the only comment he’s made along those lines. In fact, he thought something similar about 9/11.

Moore has said that the First Amendment only applies to Christians. No word on where he’s getting that from the words:

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
Moore once gave a speech to a white supremacist group that influenced Charleston shooter Dylann Roof.

Moore not only embraced birtherism, he kept on embracing it until at least 2016.

This is who has the endorsement of the second-ranking Senate Republican and who the RNC, NRSC, and Alabama Republican Party are fundraising with.

Trump claims he was 'extremely respectful' to widow ... while basically calling her a liar

2017-10-25

Donald Trump returned yet again to defend his conduct in his condolence call to Myeshia Johnson—and in so doing, call Sgt. La David Johnson’s widow a liar. “I can only say this: I was really nice to her,” Trump insisted, before going on to predictably undermine himself.

 
I respect her, I respect her family, I certainly respect La David. Who I by the way called La David right from the beginning. Just so you understand, they put a chart in front: “La David.” Says “La David Johnson.” So right from the beginning, there’s no hesitation, one of the great memories of all time, there was no hesitation.

I think she’s a fantastic woman, I was extremely nice to her, extremely respectful.
In short, “Everything she said about the conversation is false, but I think she’s fantastic.” Because Myeshia Johnson either said, or affirmed Rep. Frederica Wilson’s account, that Trump was disrespectful and specifically did not call Sgt. Johnson by name, referring to him instead as “your guy.”

Also, it’s a minor note, but Trump is claiming to have one of the great memories of all time (that seems to be what he’s saying, and not that the phone call was one of the great memories of all time, because he gestures at his head while he says it), while also saying that he had Sgt. Johnson’s name on a chart. His evidence that he has one of the great memories of all time is that he remembered a name long enough to read it on a chart and say it into the phone a split second later? We’re supposed to be impressed that he spoke the dead soldier’s name—if indeed he did, which the most believable people in this situation say he did not—because he had it on a chart in front of him?

And by the way, Trump has still not produced the proof he repeatedly claimed to have that Rep. Frederica Wilson was lying about his disrespect to Myeshia Johnson.

Republicans gut protection against bank abuses in late-night vote with Pence as tie-breaker

2017-10-25

Mike Pence cast the deciding vote Tuesday night to allow big banks to screw consumers, as the Senate repealed a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule making it easier for people to sue banks and credit card companies. The rule prevented financial institutions from forcing consumers into binding arbitration and blocking them from going to court. Instead, it opened up class-action suits as a way for people to join together and fight abuses.

Republicans didn’t like that so much, wailing about the enormous costs that would supposedly be racked up by frivolous lawsuits. You know, things like this:

For years, Wells Fargo used arbitration clauses to block lawsuits from customers who alleged that unauthorized accounts had been opened in their names. Ultimately, the bank estimated that as many as 3.5 million such accounts were opened.

The bank agreed to settle some class-actions suits, but not until the CFPB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Los Angeles city attorney’s office fined the bank over those practices last year. Even in cases that the bank settled, it had argued that the plaintiffs could not sue because of arbitration clauses.
You may remember that Equifax was forced by public outcry to remove an arbitration clause from its agreement to provide free credit monitoring to people whose personal information it allowed to be stolen. That’s the kind of thing this CFPB rule was designed to address that so outraged Republicans.

The consumer bureau had determined that the effect on the entire financial system would be less than $1 billion a year. Cordray has noted that U.S. banks earned a record $171 billion in profits in 2016.
That’s what Republicans say is just too much money wasted on frivolous lawsuits against things like unauthorized bank accounts being opened in your name or your Social Security number being stolen.

Two Republicans—South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham and Louisiana’s John Kennedy—voted no, forcing Republicans to bring in Pence. But note who voted the party line despite their criticisms of Donald Trump earlier in the day. That’s right, both Bob Corker and Jeff Flake.

What happened in Niger? Joint Chiefs of Staff chair briefs the press but offers little clarity

2017-10-23

Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr. held a press conference on Monday afternoon to update the public on the U.S. military presence in Niger (which came as a surprise to many) and the early October attack that left four American service members dead and, ultimately, led Donald Trump to kick off yet another major controversy.

The upshot of Dunford’s press conference? There’s an investigation going on and we’re not going to hear anything much we didn’t already know until that investigation is concluded. At that point, though, “We owe the families as much information as we can find out about what happened” and the American public, too, will learn more.

According to Dunford, the troops did not call for help until an hour after the ambush started, and they had French air support an hour later. But why did they not call for help for an hour? No word on that. No word on whether there were enemy combatants killed in action. No word on whether the American troops were wearing body armor.

When Dunford wasn’t saying he didn’t have the details of the attack, he was giving a master class in dodging politically loaded questions, whether on the appropriateness of directing tough questions at generals and retired generals or how to engage in the delicate matter of informing families of a loss or whether this is Trump’s Benghazi. It was a rare sight to see from behind a government podium these days.

More questions than answers about Niger attack that left four U.S. soldiers dead

2017-10-20

While there’s no serious question that Donald Trump told the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson that “he knew what he signed up for,” there are a lot of questions remaining about the attack in which Johnson and three other soldiers were killed. What information lapse allowed their team to be ambushed in unarmored pickup trucks without air support? Why was Johnson’s body not recovered for two days after the attack? What exactly is the U.S. mission in Niger, anyway? Rachel Maddow has raised further questions about whether Trump’s addition of Niger’s neighbor Chad to his travel ban, which immediately preceded a decision by Chad to withdraw troops from Niger, might have contributed to American vulnerability to ambush.

The Department of Defense has reportedly launched an investigation into the events in Niger, and it’s entirely possible that information being reported as fact now will ultimately be contradicted. Defense Secretary James Mattis has defended the initial response, saying that "The US military does not leave our troops behind, and I would just ask you not question the actions of the troops who were caught in the firefight and question whether or not they did everything they could in order to bring everyone out at once.” But:

Three senior US defense officials told CNN on Wednesday that Mattis is dismayed at the lack of detailed information he has received about the attack, but there is no indication he is trying to unduly hurry the investigation being carried out by Africa Command, according to all three officials -- all of whom are in a position to have knowledge of how Mattis views the situation.
In response to Sen. John McCain raising questions about the ambush and whether he’s getting full information about it, national security adviser H.R. McMaster said “if Sen. McCain says we need to do a better job communicating with him ... we're going to do it.” We’ll see—and we know that this is unlikely to get the kind of investigative attention from congressional Republicans that Benghazi did.

One thing we do know: Trump was at his golf course five times between when the soldiers were killed and the first time he spoke publicly about the attack.

Trump's opioid emergency promise came as news to the officials who'd need to make it happen

2017-10-20

It’s a fire drill in the Trump administration after Donald Trump promised on Monday that “next week” he’d make an emergency declaration on the opioid crisis. His advisers and the agencies that would have to make an emergency response happen were not and are not ready to do that, and go figure—it’s just not that easy:

Emergency declarations are typically used to respond to isolated events such as hurricanes and floods, or disease outbreaks. Using one to combat a nationwide epidemic with no obvious end point might require unprecedented resources and raises numerous legal and other questions, said one senior White House official. [...]

Multiple sources in and out of relevant federal agencies said that key leaders on the opioid issue had not been asked to draw up strategies and tactics.

A senior FDA official said she did not know who was in charge of the emergency declaration efforts and described the effort as “such a mess.”
Let’s repeat that: “Key leaders on the opioid issue had not been asked to draw up strategies and tactics.” That’s perfect.

To make it all a little more complicated, there’s no health and human services head since Tom Price resigned in disgrace, there’s no Drug Enforcement Association head since the last person acting in that role resigned over Trump’s lack of respect for the law, Trump’s back to square one in picking an Office of Drug Control Policy leader since his first one had to withdraw over his sponsorship of a law making it harder for the DEA to combat the opioid crisis, and a Department of Homeland Security chief to replace now-White House chief of staff John Kelly has not yet been confirmed.

All of this is probably moot, though, because the fact that Donald Trump said he’d be making an emergency declaration does not actually mean Donald Trump intends to make an emergency declaration. It means he thought that would get him some approval and good press in the moment he said it and didn’t think beyond that. So most likely he’ll end up declaring something with the word emergency in it that doesn’t commit many resources or involve a real plan, but Trump will get to sign something in front of cameras (if he remembers to do the signing part) and say he’s taking action, and that’ll be good enough to keep him happy, even if it does nothing to keep people from dying of overdoses.

Trump keeps covering his 'he knew what he signed up for' lies by attacking Rep. Frederica Wilson

2017-10-20

Two days after Donald Trump insisted it was “totally fabricated” that he told a grieving widow that a soldier killed in an ambush in Niger “knew what he signed up for,” we’re still waiting for the “proof” he claimed to have that it was a fabrication by Rep. Frederica Wilson. And though that phone call has been a major focus of the past two days, and Trump is tweeting about it again, that proof? Still nowhere to be seen.

In fact, during those two days, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has twice refused to deny that Trump said those words, followed in non-denial by White House chief of staff John Kelly. Both Sanders and Kelly worked hard, though, to blame Wilson for having the audacity to make an issue of Trump’s cruelty, and Trump went with that in his latest denial that he said the thing no one on his staff is bothering to deny that he said: The Fake News is going crazy with wacky Congresswoman Wilson(D), who was SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!
This was Kelly’s line, too: “It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation,” which was “absolutely sacred.” A sacred and very personal moment that the grieving family invited Wilson to be a part of because she had known Sgt. La David Johnson for years. A sacred and very personal moment that Trump defiled through his disrespect. When you’ve lost someone to violence, you get to choose who to surround yourself with. The Johnson family chose Rep. Frederica Wilson and they have said that Wilson’s description of the call with Trump was accurate.

So that’s what we’ve got: Trump’s gross insensitivity and disrespect on the phone with Myeshia Johnson. Trump continuing to claim Wilson is lying, when his own press secretary and chief of staff have basically conceded she’s telling the truth. An all-out White House attack on Wilson for daring to be present during a phone call when the family had invited her to be there because they knew her and she had been a mentor to the deceased and had put the call on speaker in her presence. Are Trump and Kelly saying that Gold Star families can’t surround themselves with the people whose support they want, while they’re on the way to greet a loved one’s coffin, because it might make Donald Trump look bad?

These people are monsters.

Trump tries to change the subject from 'he knew what he signed up for' to uranium

2017-10-19

Everything old is new again when you’re desperate enough. Donald Trump is struggling to get past the bad look of—once again—feuding with a Gold star family, this time having told the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson that “he knew what he signed up for.” Trump also seemed not to know Johnson’s name when he spoke to his family or Johnson’s wife Myeshia’s name when later insisting that he didn’t say “he knew what he signed up for.” Facing that firestorm, Trump returned to a favorite tactic: trying to change the subject.

Uranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow!

Yes, it’s a recycled story from early 2015 that was too weak for its author to successfully defend on Fox News but which The Hill has semi-revived with a story having absolutely zero to do with Hillary Clinton and which Fox News was, of course, talking about this morning. What we’ve known all along is that the big scandalous uranium deal that Trump is desperate to keep talking about was signed off on by nine U.S. agencies and the Canadian government, and that while the State Department was one of the nine U.S. agencies, Clinton wasn’t personally involved in the decision. 

Trump is trying to change the subject from his callous disrespect to the family of Sgt. La David Johnson. He’s only too happy to try to change the subject to one of his pet conspiracy theories, one that he’s repeatedly used to try to minimize evidence of his campaign’s collusion with Russian election meddling by linking Clinton and Russia. It’s been a desperate move all along, but his base will eat it up. Again. So remember: this story has been debunked repeatedly. This story was debunked before the New York Times and Washington Post even wrote it up in 2015. And now, it’s a naked attempt to distract from what Trump said to Myeshia Johnson.

Trump claimed to have 'proof' he didn't say slain soldier 'knew what he signed up for.' Where is it?

2017-10-19

More than 24 hours after Donald Trump tweeted that Rep. Frederica Wilson “totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof),” we’re still waiting for that proof. No, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that Trump staffers in the room when he made the call agreed that Trump was “completely respectful” doesn’t count, especially when Sanders twice refused to deny that Trump said the words “he knew what he signed up for” about Sgt. La David Johnson.

Trump didn’t just say he had proof Wilson’s account of his call to Myeshia Johnson was fabricated, either. He also said of Wilson “let her make her statement again and you’ll find out,” a threatening response that didn’t intimidate Wilson a bit—she promptly tweeted that “I still stand by my account of the call.”

Well, Donald? To recap: he said he has proof. He said “let her make her statement again and you’ll find out.” He hasn’t offered the proof; in fact, his press secretary specifically refused to say he didn’t say it. Wilson made her statement again. Her office has received threats and Wilson is now receiving protection, but what she hasn’t gotten is any kind of proof from Trump or the White House.

He said it, and he lied about saying it.
