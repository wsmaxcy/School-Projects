It's been 39 days, and Children's Health has not been funded

2017-11-08

What's it going to take to make Republicans in Congress show even a shread of humanity and take care of the nation's kids?

Is it going to take a referendum on how America feels about health care? Because we pretty much had that last night with the overwhelming votes in Virginia and Maine. Do they need polling? Because there is polling.

September 2017 polling on CHIP reauthorization
Is it going to take the threat of 9 million children losing health insurance and lots of red state governors and legislators having to figure out which kids to cut, how to stem their losses? How about the knowledge that 62 percent of Republicans think CHIP reauthorization should be a top priority?

It's time. We need to shut down their phone lines, jam their fax machines, and fill up their email inboxes. We need to push as hard for CHIP and community health center funding as we did to kill Trumpcare. We need to keep them scared after Tuesday's election.

Jam the phone lines of House and Senate Republicans. Call (202) 224-3121, and tell them to stop holding kids hostage and to pass a clean funding bill for CHIP and community health centers.

Medicaid expansion on ballots in 2018: It's a 'no-brainer'

2017-11-08

Maine and Virginia sent a resounding message Tuesday night about Medicaid expansion: the people want it. They said so directly with a ballot proposal in Maine and in the exit polling in Virginia where the legislature has been the roadblock to expansion, healthcare was cited as the most important issue with 78 percent of those voters breaking for the Democrats. It turns out that health care is something people actually want.

That bodes well for efforts in other states where Medicaid expansion is being blocked by governors or legislatures. Like Idaho, where for three years running independent panels named by Gov. Butch Otter have recommended expansion for the state's 78,000 uninsured individuals who would qualify, but where Otter has refused to act. Idahoans are turning to a ballot initiative for 2018, preparing to start collecting the 48,000 signatures they need.

"It seemed like a time for change," Luke Mayville, co-founder of Reclaim Idaho, a group leading the ballot initiative effort, said Monday.
"We wanted to get involved in the 2018 election and Medicaid expansion was a no-brainer."
It is a no-brainer. Enough so that activists in Utah are doing the same to cover the 120,000 uninsured there. They've submitted the initiative language in preparation for signature gathering there.

National organizations are looking to get Medicaid on state ballots in more red states, including even Kansas, which mirrors Maine's experience. The legislature has approved expansion, only to see it vetoed by Gov. Sam Brownback.

"We would love to put Medicaid on the ballot in as many states as possible," says Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, a national nonprofit that has supported the Maine initiative. […]
"A ballot initiative allows you to go around the political process and go straight to the people," says Schleifer.
Getting expansion on the ballots in these states could do another thing—it could discourage more repeal efforts by congressional Republicans. Because after Tuesday's vote, they're going to be running a little bit scared.

Maine votes to expand Medicaid, Gov. LePage has a tantrum

2017-11-08

While the Trump resistance was sweeping state and local elections across the nation, Maine voters were resisting their idiot Republican governor, Paul LePage, finally overriding his multiple vetoes of Medicaid expansion with a ballot measure winning with an 18-point margin. Expansion could extend health care to around 80,000 uninsured Mainers.

LePage's response? He's going to find every way he can to stop it from happening, because that's just what he does.

 Abby Goodnough ✔@abbygoodnough
1) Gov LePage of Maine now says he won’t expand Medicaid “until it’s been fully funded by the Legislature” at the amount his DHHS calculated

Of course, as Goodnough points out, LePage's DHHS estimate of how much it will cost the state is much higher than that of the "nonpartisan state office that does budget research." So what happens now is a little up in the air. LePage can't veto a ballot measure like he has the multiple expansion bill the Maine legislature has passed.

What he can do is send the bill back to the legislature for approval. That has to happen within 45 days of the beginning of the session. The ballot measure itself requires that the state submit a plan to the Trump administration within 90 days. That leaves a lot of room for uncertainty.

At the same time, the legislature and Presidential administration has changed since these votes and the legislature never had the votes to override a veto. Taken together, the process of Maine expanding Medicaid could take a significant amount of time if the Governor and state legislature so decides.
Given the overwhelming margin of the win for Medicaid here, the legislature might be more inclined to make this happen. But it's not going to happen without a fight from both LePage and Trump.

Republicans aim another attack at health care in their tax cuts bill

2017-11-08

Meet another one of the big losers in the Republican "Tax Cuts for Donald Trump" bill.

“Anybody who is paying for the cost of nursing home care is paying a great deal of money, and they are going to lose that deduction, and their taxes are going to go up,” said Thomas DeCoursey, a retired lawyer from Kansas, in his 70s.
He relies on the deduction to help offset costs associated with nursing home care for his wife, who has Alzheimer’s. Some of his own medical expenses also factor in. DeCoursey estimates that in a couple of years their annual costs will pass $100,000.

“There are a lot of people in my shoes,” said DeCoursey, who lives in Leawood, a well-to-do Kansas City suburb that voted for President Donald Trump last year.
Only about 6 percent of tax filers, or 9 million households, qualify for the deductions on medical expenses. But for those nine million middle- and upper-middle income families, it's helping to keep them financially afloat. The threat of eliminating this deduction, which accounts for a relatively minor hit to the government of $10 billion, is one of the reason the AARP is rallying members in opposition to the bill. "For people who are sick, many of whom are going to be older Americans, this medical expense deduction makes their health care more affordable,” said Cristina Martin Firvida a lobbyist for AARP. "To them, it is a very big deal."

Beyond long-term nursing home care, it gives a break for other major medical expenses like fertility treatments, expensive medical equipment for home health care, long-distance travel expenses for specialized care including cancer treatment centers, or extensive dental procedures. The expenses have to exceed 10 percent of income, in most cases, and can only be used for people itemizing deductions. So it's not a huge number of taxpayers, but for those people, it's a big deal.

As long as our healthcare system remains as messed up as it is, as long as medical expenses can break families financially, we need all the help we can get.

Trump administration has plan to dump people out of Medicaid

2017-11-07

House Speaker Paul Ryan's sociopathic teenaged dream of destroying Medicaid died with the demise of Trumpcare in the Senate, but popular vote loser Donald Trump is doing his best to resurrect it, all in the name of "flexibility" for the states. The administration is announcing that it will start allowing states to impose big hurdles to enrollment, including things like work requirements and drug tests. Because making sure the most people possible have access to good health care is "a hollow victory of numbers."

In a statement distributed to reporters Tuesday morning, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma called the goal of covering more people a "hollow victory of numbers," and instead called for changes that "reduce federal regulatory burdens, increase efficiency, and promote transparency and accountability."

The announcement also promises to fast-track approval of states’ proposed Medicaid changes (which HHS grants in the form of waivers from existing Medicaid requirements) and to scrap some of the requirements that states report back to the federal government whether the changes improve health outcomes for recipients.
So not only are they making it easier for the state to keep people from enrolling and to kick current enrollees off the program, but they're being let off the hook for ensuring the changes they make actually improve the health of their Medicaid population. Eight states—Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Maine, Utah, and Wisconsin—have already requested these waivers. Some of those requests happened under the Obama administration, which refused to grant them. There's a good reason: the vast, vast majority of Medicaid recipients are not the lazy, able-bodied shirkers Republicans want you to believe they are.

Just 27 percent of Medicaid enrollees are adults who don’t have disabilities, and 60 percent of those people are already working. Having to jump through the administrative hurdles of proving that they have jobs or taking drug tests or doing whatever else a Republican governor or legislature says they have to do will discourage people from signing up. That’s the whole point here. One way or another, Republicans are going to make sure millions of people who they think are undeserving don’t get health care.

Obamacare enrollments surge in the first week—let's keep that resistance going!

2017-11-07

The Affordable Care Act is the Energizer Bunny of federal law. Nothing Republicans have done to try to kill it has stopped it from marching forward. Literally dozens of repeal votes by Republicans in the House, a total fiasco of a repeal attempt in the Republican Senate, and every bit of sabotage popular vote loser Donald Trump could throw at it, and it just keeps going.

Why? Us. We're not letting it happen. When Trump gutted the administration's traditional outreach for the upcoming plan year, the grassroots stepped up to try to fill the void, knowing that there was no way that we could match what the federal government could do to get the word out and get people signed up. Or is there?

More than 200,000 Americans chose a plan on Nov. 1, the day open enrollment began, according to one administration official. That's more than double the number of consumers who signed up on the first day of enrollment last year. More than 1 million people visited HeathCare.gov, the official federal website, this official said, which amounts to a roughly 33 percent increase in traffic compared to 2016. […]
But on opening day many state exchange officials said that enrollment had exceeded their projections.

Connect for Health Colorado spokesman Luke Clarke said state officials had anticipated 2,700 residents would log onto their exchange, but more than 4,000 did. "Enrollment year five could be a record year," Clarke said. "It's way ahead of where we were last year, and a big surprise."
More than double last year's signups on day one. More than double. That the response on the federal Healthcare.gov, which 38 states use to run their exchanges. The remaining 12 states and the District of Columbia operate their own exchanges. Charles Gaba has continued his heroic work of keeping track of enrollments for the new plan year, and his  early indications from Maryland, Washington State, and California "were extremely promising starts (MD up 70%, CA up 25% and WA 'robust' in general)." Looks like that's a trend.

It's very early—not even a full week into the six week open enrollment period, and we've got to keep this momentum up. You can help, by joining the Open Enrollment Street Team volunteers helping Get America Covered. The more people who sign up, the harder it will be for Trump and the Republicans to take coverage away from millions.

More Obamacare sabotage from Trump means we have to resist harder: Get enrolled

2017-11-06

Popular vote loser Donald Trump is reportedly prepared to do the most extreme thing he can to destroy the Affordable Care Act—gut the individual mandate with an executive order if the mandate repeal isn't included in the tax cuts bill. That's what a Republican senator is telling the Washington Examiner.

According to the senator, an executive order is sitting with the Office of Management and Budget waiting for approval. President Trump decided to delay the executive order after Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., pushed for the inclusion of the individual mandate repeal in the tax bill, and has been supportive of its inclusion in statements he has made on Twitter.
Trump can't repeal the mandate on his own, but the law leaves room for whoever is in the White House to determine the "hardship exemptions" that allow people to get out of paying the penalty for not having insurance coverage. The exemption was created for the kinds of real-life situations—natural disasters, death of a family member, domestic violence—that can break an individual or family financially. Trump can—and appears to be ready to—broaden the exemption to make the mandate's penalties basically not apply to anyone.

That, like outright repeal of the mandate, could end up with as many as 15 million people losing insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Because with no penalty for not signing up, healthy people will just decide not to, leaving a sicker and sicker pool of people in the markets and making premiums skyrocket. That's the Republican idea of freedom.

But you can help counteract that. Join the Open Enrollment Street Team volunteers helping Get America Covered to get the word that it's open enrollment in Obamacare right now, and that getting insured could be more affordable than ever. The more people who sign up, the harder it will be for Trump and the Republicans to take coverage away from millions.

Paul Ryan's tax cuts bill, with all the warped social engineering of his fondest dreams

2017-11-06

You know a tax cuts bill cooked up by Republicans has to be a total disaster for the majority of people if House Speaker Paul Ryan, the nation's leading sociopathic fake wonk, is this giddy about the thing.

[M]embers say their speaker, the former chairman of the ways and means panel, is a "happy warrior," exuberant as he leads his party through a tax overhaul he's been talking about since he first landed on Capitol Hill in the early 1990s to work for Wisconsin Sen. Bob Kasten, a Republican who believed—like Ryan—that tax cuts were fundamental to spurring economic growth. […]
"I think Ryan's been careful not to micromanage this bill and to leave it to the committee and certainly leave it to Chairman Brady, but at the end of the day if somebody's got to make a call above the chairman level -- and that happens in every bill -- that's what the speaker's role is," said Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican and ally of leadership's.

"We know who's running this show," Cole added. "There's no question who the quarterback of this is and that's the speaker, but the star running back is undoubtedly the chairman."
Chart showing increase in cuts for very wealthy in House GOP tax cuts plan over time.
It's not enough that the bill is massively skewed to the rich, a skewing that increases over time so that by "2027 the middle fifth of Americans would receive only one sixth of the benefits received by the richest one percent of Americans." The poorest Americans, of course, get pretty much zilch.

But the tax cuts plan isn't just a statement about who Ryan wants to help, but who he wants to hurt and the really warped social engineering he's pursuing.

That's why a so-called tax bill "includes changes that would codify the rights of 'unborn children,' allow tax-exempt religious organizations to engage in political activities and impose hurdles for immigrants seeking to claim refundable tax credits." It's a Paul Ryan wet dream, with a big old dollop of religious extremism. It's got everything Ryan could want, punishing all those people he thinks are undeserving, rewarding his version of the righteous—the economic winners.

Resist. Hold Ryan and House Republicans responsible by helping future Democratic challengers with your $1.

Jam the phone lines of House Republicans to make sure they can't pass the tax bill. Call your House member at (202) 224-3121, and tell them NO on the Republican tax plan that showers more breaks on the wealthy.

Trump's unqualified judicial nominee had a rough hearing

2017-11-04

Things didn't go well this week for Leonard Steven Grasz in his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings. He's been nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. He's also been rated as not qualified to serve a lifetime federal judicial appointment by the American Bar Association. That rating featured prominently, and unfortuately, for Grasz.

With Grasz sitting in front of the committee, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) read aloud passages from the ABA's eight-page statement outlining why Grasz earned such a terrible and rarely designated rating by the nation's premier legal society.
"I assume you're keenly aware that you are the first Circuit Court nominee since 2006 to receive a unanimous ‘not qualified' rating from the ABA?" Whitehouse asked Grasz. "And that the last nominee who had such a rating was withdrawn?"

"That is my understanding, senator," replied Grasz.

Awkward! It only got worse.

"Do you think that this is a matter as to which the committee should have no concern?" asked Whitehouse.

"I have great respect for the amount of time and effort the American Bar Association put into the process," said Grasz. "I respectfully disagree with the result."
Whitehouse asked him then if he was aware that the vote was unanimous, 14-0, that he was not qualified. "I'm not keenly aware of that," he replied. "I believe there was one abstention." Yes, Whitehouse answered. "That’s why it’s 14. There are 15 of them ... It's the full panel of 14 non-abstaining lawyers." So, ouch. The ABA gave this rating because they concluded that Grasz would be "unable to separate his role as an advocate from that of a judge." That and in interviews with Grasz's colleagues, they learned he was often "gratuitously rude" and that many had an "unusual fear" that were they to say anything bad about him, they would suffer professionally because of his "deep connection and allegiance" to powerful politicians in his home state of Nebraska.

Speaking of which, Republican Nebraska Sen. Deb Fischer (who recommended him to Trump) is "shocked" at the ABA rating and is certain that this is all "a baseless political character assassination" because she didn't hear "one single temperament issue" about Grasz in all her discussions about him with Nebraskans. Well, yeah. The ABA kind of explained that by saying people were afraid to speak against him because of his power connections. Like to Fischer. And of course claiming it's politics is bullshit by virtue of the fact that 40 out of 42 of Trump's nominees got a "qualified" or "well qualified" rating, even though some of them are political extremists.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa has invited the ABA to come testify about Grasz in two weeks, if the White House hasn't decided to pull the nomination by then. Which it probably won't do. Have you looked at who is sitting behind the big desk in the Oval Office? Like he knows from qualified.

House Republicans pass sham Children's Health bill, put 9 million kids in jeopardy

2017-11-03

The House Republicans, along with a handful of not-very-bright Democrats, passed their poisoned Children's Health Insurance Program funding bill Friday, 242-174. This is not a children's health bill. This is an Obamacare and Medicare sabotage bill. It jeopardizes the CHIP program even more than if it hadn't passed because this bill is too poisoned to pass the Senate, which means it will create further delays as the Senate and House have to figure out a compromise. And at this point, 34 days after the funding authorization for the program has expired, every day that passes makes it harder for states to keep the program going and plan for its future. Every day that passes puts more kids in jeopardy of losing their coverage.

The bill contains several poison pills, including making Medicare premiums more expensive for some higher-income beneficiaries. Because it wouldn't be a Republican "health" bill if it didn't attack Medicare. It also wouldn't be a Republican "health" bill if it didn't threaten the health insurance of people enrolled in Obamacare plans. Which it does. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities highlights a provision in the bill that "would take insurance away from as many as 688,000 low- and moderate-income people each year who miss a premium payment."

People who now get federal advance premium tax credits (APTC) to help them afford insurance in the health care marketplaces have three months to pay overdue premiums before insurers can end their coverage. The legislation would shorten that grace period to one determined by state law—generally 30 days or less—making it harder for enrollees to catch up on missed payments. While a few states may mitigate the harm by enacting longer state grace periods, most would likely keep their existing grace periods.
As we've written, the current grace period is far from a free ride. If a person doesn't catch up on all overdue premiums by the end of the third month, his or her coverage ends retroactively to the end of the first month of the grace period.
It's not enough to jeopardize health insurance for 9 million kids, they have to wrap in hundreds of thousands of low-income Obamacare enrollees. This bill can't pass the Senate, where there is a clean, bipartisan bill negotiated by Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Ron Wyden (D-OR). But Mitch McConnell hasn't shown any inclination to bring that bill to the floor, instead focusing on jamming through popular vote loser Donald Trump's extremist judicial nominees.

So what the House Republican's really achieved here with this vote was adding to the delay in funding the program, increasing the likelihood that states are going to have to freeze enrollments and start winding down their CHIP programs. Just so Republicans can continue to play politics with Obamacare and Medicare.
