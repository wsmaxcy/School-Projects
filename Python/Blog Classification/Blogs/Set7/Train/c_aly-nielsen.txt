Neutral! WashPost Owner Bezos Wins 'Equality' Award for Gay Activism

2017-10-31

Ethical journalists are to avoid conflicts of interests, yet The Washington Post’s owner was just honored for his extensive gay rights activism.

Post owner Jeff Bezos, who also owns Amazon, received the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) National Equality Award on Nov. 28, 2017. In his acceptance speech, he claimed to want Amazon employees to be “empowered to speak their mind and to be heard.”

HRC describes itself as the “largest national lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer civil rights organization.” Its National Equality Award recognizes “the outstanding efforts of those who publicly stand up for the LGBTQ community, committing their time and energy to improve the lives of LGBTQ people and advance equality for all Americans.”

“Every Amazonian should feel comfortable sharing their unique perspectives and every Amazonian should seek out the perspectives of others,” Bezos added.

While the sentiment sounded amiable, the context of the speech made clear the “equality” he wanted at Amazon was total acceptance and affirmation of gay marriage and the LGBT lifestyle.

Bezos received the award in part because he was “one of the largest financial backers of the fight for marriage equality,” HRC said. He spent at least $2.5 million pushing Washington state to legally recognize gay marriage in 2012.

Bezos’ activism wouldn’t be a problem, except he owns The Washington Post. The Society of Professional Journalists’ Code of Ethics instructs journalists to “avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived.”

While Bezos is not a journalist himself, his activism reflects strongly on the companies he owns, including Amazon and The Post. When Bezos purchased The Post in 2013, he stated “The values of The Post do not need changing,” despite the newspaper’s already established liberal bias.

Bezos’ statement on employees feeling “comfortable” talking about their “unique perspectives” is especially ironic since the tech industry has shown in the past it does not actually respect unique perspectives. Google for example fired an employee for sharing his opinion just three months ago.

In a memo sent to employees, James Damore accused Google of fostering a liberal environment and also touted the unpopular opinion that women are not as involved in the tech industry because of biological differences. Damore was fired days later.

'Women's March' Convention Partners Boast $85M from Soros

2017-10-27

Feminists were outraged when the Women’s March announced a man, Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders, would begin its October Women’s Convention. That was changed, but it turns out, there’s another old, white man prominently connected to convention partners: liberal billionaire George Soros.

The Women’s March is hosting a Women’s Convention in Detroit, Mich. from Oct. 27 to Oct. 29 called “Reclaiming Our Time.” The conference aims to plug into the “power of women in leadership,” but its sponsors and partners have received more than $85 million in funding from Soros.

While the event claims to work for “collective liberation” for all women regardless of religion or background, it has excluded pro-life conservative women, just as it did in January during the Women’s March. With workshops on everything from abortion to anti-Trump activism and only Democratic political speakers, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.), the convention proved that conservative and pro-life women are not welcome.

The event boasts star media power with speakers like CNN commentator Sally Kohn and actresses Rose McGowan (Charmed) and Amber Tamblyn (Django Unchained).

As with the anti-Trump Women’s March in January, the Women’s Convention is backed by numerous groups that have been lavishly funded by left-wing billionaires. For example, 16 of the Women’s Convention partners and sponsors received nearly $85 million from Soros between 2000 and 2014. This should be no surprise since at least 100 of the Women’s March partners received more than $246 million from Soros.

Soros-funded Women’s Convention sponsors included Planned Parenthood, MoveOn.org and the ACLU. Soros has also given more than $4 million to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), whose political action arm is also sponsoring the convention.

That doesn’t even include the half million Soros’ daughter recently donated to Planned Parenthood Votes. Nor the $1.5 million Soros gave to cover-up the 2015 Planned Parenthood scandal. Leaked documents from Soros’ Open Society Foundations revealed that it helped fund the abortion giant’s “vigorous defense” against videos claiming Planned Parenthood sold body parts of aborted babies for profit.

NextGen America PAC, run by liberal climate activist and billionaire Tom Steyer, is another Women’s Convention sponsor. Steyer is currently spending millions of dollars trying to impeach President Donald Trump, and was also the largest individual donor in both the 2014 and 2016 elections, pouring more than $166 million straight into the pockets of liberal candidates.

Steyer has made it clear he wants the “impeachment of Donald Trump” to be the central issue for the 2018 election, and his giving history proves he will spend millions trying to accomplish his goals.

The mega-donor started funding liberals as a way to push his radical climate change agenda, but in 2017 he branched out (including rebranding his NextGen Climate PAC to NextGen America) in order to advocate more liberal positions on immigration and healthcare.

9 Times Hollywood Confessed Its Sexual Harassment Culture Before Weinstein

2017-10-26

Sexual harassment and abuse by Hollywood elites should be obvious to anyone who watches the movies and TV shows Hollywood produces.

The fact is, Hollywood never hid its sexual harassment or abuse in fiction — often depicting “casting couch” scenarios, turning harassment and assault into jokes and depicting rape fantasies as “love.”

So it should be no surprise that the number of Hollywood stars making allegations of sexual harassment, assault and even rape by industry professionals continues to grow. In an Oct. 16, speech for Elle’s Women in Hollywood event, Reese Witherspoon shared some of her experiences including that she had been sexually assaulted by a director at 16 years of age and “felt that silence was a condition of my employment.”

She joined a long list of women and men who have made serious allegations about abusive sexual behavior common in the film business following The New York Times’ explosive Oct. 5, report about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. The investigation alleged he had been sexually harassing women for nearly 30 years.

Just days later, The New Yorker published three rape allegations against Weinstein. Since The Times report, more than 40 women have come forward with accusations Weinstein harassed or assaulted them.

While it seemed like a dirty secret, the ongoing revelations seem to indicate these behaviors were well known inside the business. In fact, the Associated Press traced allegations of sexual misconduct by producers, directors and actors back to at least 1921. The AP story recounted examples including Shirley Temple’s claim a producer exposed himself to her when she was only 12, the frequent propositioning and groping of Judy Garland in her teenage years and Joan Collins’ claim she lost the lead in “Cleopatra” by refusing to sleep with the studio head.

Onscreen, Hollywood was even less secretive about abuse entrenched in its depraved, business culture. Here are just nine films or television examples that prove it.

1. 30 Rock - 2006-2013

30 Rock follows a live comedy show writer as she tries to handle a demanding boss, actors and difficult deadlines. But this show was more open than most actually using Harvey Weinstein’s name in jokes about sexual harassment several times.

In season six (2012), actress Jenna Maroney tries to get a cease and desist order against Weird Al Yankovic because he keeps parodying her songs. When someone tells her she doesn’t want to mess with Weird Al, she says “I’m not afraid of anyone in show business! I turned down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions — out of five.”

In season seven, Maroney tries to console a friend who misses their ex by saying “I know how former lovers can have a hold over you long after they’re gone. In some ways, I’m still pinned under a passed-out Harvey Weinstein, and it’s Thanksgiving,” Think Progress reported.

Weinstein jokes weren’t 30 Rock’s only examples of sexual harassment. During a script reading in one scene, a male actor compliments a female on her “beautiful skin,” to which the woman replies that she is married to a woman.

“I’ve got four inches of steel that might change your mind,” he replies while leering at her.

 


 

2. The Last Tycoon - 2016

Amazon’s original production of The Last Tycoon, based on an unfinished F. Scott Fitzgerald book, shows the extreme competition between studios in 1930s Hollywood, the glamour of moviemaking and the darkness beneath it all. And sex, sex and more sex.

Studio executive Ray Brady for example, is a repeat offender who sleeps with his secretaries, actresses and sometimes their managers. Actress Margo Taft knows Brady’s incessant sexual predation and how desperate he is to have her in his movie, turns the tables on him. She asks him what he would do if forced to choose between sleeping with her and having her in his movie. He then tells her he’s wondering how he can “end up with both.”

She accepts the film role, but only after he agrees to her demands — which include a percentage of box office grosses and a private meeting with the film director in which he must expose himself to her. Disturbingly, Bustle thought that Taft’s “gumption” was fantastic even though that would also be sexual harassment of a man by a woman.

Ultimately, Taft didn’t make the director drop his pants. She later explains to someone that as a child actress she was abused by Hollywood manager who literally pimped her out. Requiring her directors to humiliate themselves in front of her is her form of revenge for that early sexual abuse.

3. Gods and Monsters - 1998

The Oscar-winning fictionalized drama Gods and Monsters is based on real-life film British director James Whale who directed Frankenstein in 1931 and other horror classics. Whale was homosexual.

Early in Gods and Monsters, Whale tells a reporter that in his early days in Hollywood, “if you were a star, nobody cared [inaudible] who you slept with as long as you kept it out of the papers.” When it came to “us directors,” people didn’t even know their names, Whale said, let alone care what they do. Whale only answers the reporter’s questions after he agreed to remove an article of clothing for each question he asked.

The movie mostly portrays Whale, well into retirement, befriending a young and handsome gardener Clayton Boone. Boone is straight, and repeatedly tells Whale he is not interested in a relationship.

Despite Whale assuring Boone “I have no interest in your body,” he still makes Boone uncomfortable by graphically describing his own sexual history. At the end of the film, Whale kisses and gropes Boone, and then threatens to blackmail him with by telling people “I’ve been kissing you, I even touched your prick! How will you ever be able to live with yourself?” Whale justifies his actions by saying he was trying to get Boone to strangle him.

Gods and Monsters illustrated that sexual harassment in Hollywood by the powerful elites isn’t only reserved for women.

4. Casting Couch - 2013

Given the sordid history of real life directors’ “casting couch” behavior to extract sexual favors in exchange for onscreen roles, it’s not surprising at all that filmmaker Jason Lockhart decided to make a movie about six sleazy guys and their “ultimate plan to hook up” by casting a fake movie full of “hot chicks.” “We aren’t casting for their talent,” one of the men blatantly declares.

The men use the fake auditions to get attractive women to kiss them, strip, and pose for photo shoots. At one point, a women remarks uncomfortably, “the casting didn’t say anything about nudity.”

Ultimately, the fake moviemakers are only interested in finding out “who’s willing to go the farthest to get the part.”

5. Tootsie - 1982

In Tootsie, Dustin Hoffman plays struggling actor Michael Dorsey who masquerades as Dorothy Michaels in order to get a part on a soap opera. The film is a comedy about acting and daytime dramas that turns sexual harassment and sexual assault into a joke because the woman is actually a man dressed in drag.

After being given a shared dressing room, Dorothy read script changes for the day’s shooting and exclaims, “Oh, my goodness. I have to kiss Dr. Brewster.” Co-star April Paige (played by Geena Davis), replies nonchalantly, “Oh yeah, he kisses all the women on the show. We call him ‘The Tongue.’”

Before the scene which is supposed to include the onscreen kiss, the actor playing Dr. Brewster looks Dorothy over and says “You’re Dorothy Michaels aren’t you? I’m John Van Horn. We’re up next,” and then squirts breath freshener in his mouth while leering at Dorothy.

Although Dorothy deflects the onscreen kiss by ad-libbing, shortly afterwards the lecherous John Van Horn engages her in conversion and forces a long kiss on her. He walks away smiling while Dorothy stands there in stunned silence.

Later in the film, Dorothy returns home to find Van Horn outside her apartment. He had followed her home the day before to find it. He claims to just want to talk and begs her to let him come in for a “tiny moment.” Dorothy only invites him in after Van Horn disturbs the neighbors by singing in the street.

“Dorothy I want you. I’ve never wanted a woman this much,” Van Horn tells her and tries to force himself on her. In the midst of a physical struggle, Van Horn says “I’ll take straight sex” and he continues struggling to obtain it. He ignored the fact that Dorothy hasn’t consented and is physically trying to stop the attempted rape.

Michael’s male roommate Jeff arrives before Van Horn succeeds and Van Horn, assuming the roommate is Dorothy’s boyfriend, tells him “for the record, nothing happened here tonight” and then apologizes to Dorothy and says “I didn’t understand.”

Although played for humor because Dorothy is actually Michael, “rape is not a laughing matter” — a point Michael makes to Jeff once Van Horn is gone.

In other scenes, intimate physical contact is also shown casually, such as a director patting an actress’ butt on set after giving her directions for a scene and telling the entire cast about "his desires" for her because they are involved offscreen. The same director is shown covertly kissing a different actress later.

Pretending to be a woman makes Dorsey witness and experience the condescension, lies and harassment women in the television industry endure and ultimately makes him a better man.

6. Californication - 2007-2014

The Showtime TV series Californication is about troubled writer Hank Moody who tries to escape his writer’s block by moving to California and reveling in sex and drugs. A total womanizer, Moody sleeps with at least 21 women throughout the show’s seven seasons, including his ex-wife’s fiance’s underage daughter (For that he is found guilty of statutory rape and sentenced to three years probation). Unsurprisingly, Moody sexually harassed many women as well.

In one episode, after accidentally spilling a woman’s drink in her lap, Moody makes a sexual joke about her and puts his hand in her lap to wipe it up with a napkin. She is visibly shaken and pushes him away, but he continues to comment on her appearance. After a few moments, the show portrays her warming up to him, sending the message that if a man calls a woman beautiful enough times, he can get away with sexually harassing her.

While teaching a writing class, he makes a joke about masturbating, at which point a fellow professor asks him if he took the sexual harassment seminar. He reacts with surprise, acting like he didn’t know what he did wrong.

In another instance, Moody comments that one of his students is “smoking” hot, and claims it doesn’t matter that he’s old enough to be her father because he isn’t actually her father. When his TA resigns, he teases her that it must be because she finds him “irresistible.”

7. The Day of the Locust - 1975

The Day of the Locust is an adaptation of a 1939 Nathanael West novel about artist Tod Hackett who is hired to design and decorate sets for Hollywood films.

The trailer for the film claims it is an “unforgettable vision of love, success and dreams” in 1930s Hollywood. It failed to mention Hackett’s obsession over a young actress includes violent rape fantasies about her.

Hackett meets and becomes infatuated with young aspiring actress Faye Green, who considers him a friend and tells him outright she will only love a rich, handsome man. The trailer wrongly describes his feelings differently claiming “he loved her enough to believe in her fantasy,” even though his fantasies prove his feelings weren’t loving at all.

8. Entourage - 2004-2011

Long-running television series Entourage also demonstrated that women are not the only victims of sexual harassment and abuse in Hollywood.

The show was an HBO series produced by Mark Wahlberg, who described the series as being loosely based on his own early acting career. The show follows young actor Vincent Chase as he learns how to survive in Hollywood.

In Season 3, Chase’s agent Ari Gold is working to book a gay actor, Jay Lester. Lester agrees to sign with Gold, but only if Gold’s assistant Lloyd Lee (who is also gay) brings the contract himself, late at night because “it’s a tradition” for Lester to do a “signing ceremony” with his agents’ assistants. It’s clearly implied that this “ceremony” is sexual in nature.

When Lee privately protests, Gold tells him “all great men have had to make great sacrifices” and encourages Lee to justify going by “whatever gets you through the night.”

Later, Lester insists he’s already wined and dined Lee, and he won’t sign the contract unless Lee goes home to sleep with him. Gold pulls Lee out of Lester’s arms and says, “we may be whores at my agency, but we ain’t pimps.”

But the scene, as in some other movies and shows, was presented as a joke, with Lee finally slapping Lester in the face after Lester insinuates he would be an unsatisfying sexual partner because of his race.

9. L.A. Confidential - 1997

Although L.A. Confidential is a film noir set in 1953 primarily about corrupt cops who beat up prisoners and sometimes kill criminals rather than arresting them, shows the seedy side of the filmmaking business, according to Roger Ebert’s film review.

“The film is steeped in L.A. lore; [Author James] Ellroy is a student of the city's mean streets. It captures the town just at that postwar moment when it was beginning to become self-conscious about its myth,” Ebert wrote. “Joseph Wambaugh writes in one of his books that he is constantly amazed by the hidden threads that connect the high to the low, the royalty to the vermin, in Los Angeles--where a hooker is only a role from stardom, and vice, as they say, versa.”

In it, pornographer Pierce Patchett is a millionaire. Porn isn’t his only business — he “is running whores, cut to look like movie stars. Judging by his address, something bigger on the side,” according to Officer White (Russell Crowe). The prostitutes are eager young actresses who moved to Hollywoodland with big acting dreams, and then made over through plastic surgery to resemble real movie stars, like Veronica Lake.

But in the course of investigating a nightclub shootout, the police officers learn something much bigger is going on involving hookers, blackmail, the D.A.’s office and police officers.

One officer is shot dead by a superior after telling him Patchett had a blackmail scheme which involved photographing prominent businessmen with hookers that was connected to murder and corrupt cops. Later White and another officer shake down the D.A. and learn the pornographer and a Police Captain Dudley Smith partnered to take over gangster Mickey Cohen’s rackets and do whatever it takes to keep their secret.

Soros Shifts $18 Billion To Foundation He Uses To Fund Left

2017-10-17

Left-wing financier George Soros just nearly tripled the size of his foundation by adding an additional $18 billion in assets. The foundation has funded liberal activism on immigration, abortion, journalism and a myriad of other issues. Its soon-to-be president was also formerly a DNC executive director.

Soros transferred the billions to Open Society Foundations (OSF) from his hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, The Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 17, 2017. The transfer increased OSF’ assets from $7.3 billion (according to Foundation Directory) to $25.3 billion.

According to OSF, Soros has given away roughly $14 billion throughout his lifetime, much of which has been used to attack religion and advance a liberal agenda on immigration, abortion, hate speech, the Women’s March and environmentalism.

Soros has also funneled more than $103 million to journalism groups around the world including ProPublica, NPR and Columbia University. Partner organizations for the anti-Trump Women’s March in January 2017 had also received $246 million from Soros between 2000 and 2014.

Soros also gave at least $10.5 million to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. According to an October, 2016, Washington Times report, Clinton’s foreign policy during the election was strikingly similar to Soros’. Media outlets that backed her campaign or policies had received an additional $61 million in prior years.

When Clinton lost the election, the Soros and other liberal donors met in Washington, D.C. to address the “cataclysm” of Donald Trump as the 45th president.

But Soros supported Clinton far before the election. While she was still Secretary of State under President Barack Obama, leaked emails showed Soros advising Clinton on foreign policy in Albania -- advice she seems to have followed.

Soros’ international meddling has been far more direct than merely advising foreign policy.

OSF operates in seven different global regions including the U.S., Africa, Latin America and Europe. Through the various OSF branches, Soros has started revolutions, undermined national currencies and funded radical groups throughout the world.

According to the former U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Morton Abramowitz, Soros is the “only private citizen who had his own foreign policy.”

Because of his habit of causing instability, Soros has been denounced in many countries, and even banned from some.

For example, Russia described Soros as “a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation,” in 2015 and prohibited him from operating in the nation. A similar scenario played out in Russia in 2003 as well.

Soros’ own home-country Hungary announced in January 2017 it would “sweep out” NGOs funded by the liberal billionaire, Bloomberg reported. The Israeli foreign ministry backed Hungary’s decision, saying Soros “continuously undermines Israel’s democratically elected governments.”

OSF has repeatedly backed Palestinians against Israel, and condemns the so-called “Israeli occupation” of Gaza and the West Bank.

By transferring $18 billion to OSF, Soros has signaled he intends this left-wing agenda to remain well-funded long after his death.

Americans for Tax Reform president Grover Norquist speculated on Twitter Soros made the transfer as a way to hide from the “death tax.”

Inside Philanthropy reported in 2016 Soros seemed to be making preparations for his children to carry on “his philanthropy when he is no longer around.” Both Jonathan, Andrea and Alexander Soros are OSF board members.

Additionally, Soros praised OSF president Christopher Stone in September for successfully preparing the foundation “to be run by a global board when Mr. Soros, 87, is no longer involved,” The Journal reported on Sept. 11.

Stone has resigned from OSF, effective January 2018, and will be replaced by OSF vice president Patrick Gaspard. According to his bio, Gaspard served as the U.S. ambassador to South Africa under President Barack Obama. He was also the executive director of the Democratic National Committee, was a director of the White House Office of Political affairs and was the national political director for Obama for America in 2008.

Largest Democrat Donor Steyer Demands Trump Impeachment

2017-10-12

Liberal climate activist Tom Steyer -- the largest Democrat donor -- wants impeaching President Donald Trump to be a “defining issue” during the 2018 election.

This week, Steyer sent a letter demanding Congressional Democrats pledge support to impeaching Trump, The New York Times reported Oct. 11, 2017. The letter “represents a significant boost to efforts on the left to make impeachment a mainstream political consideration.”

Steyer previously accused Trump of a “traitorous act of war” when he withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement in May, 2017. He also rebranded his Political Action Committee to fund liberal policies beyond climate change.

The Times also suggested Steyer may be “considering a run for Senate.”

Steyer was the largest spender in the 2016 election, donating more than $91 million to Democrat candidates and PACs. Because of that spending, Steyer “may not be an easy figure for Democrats to ignore,” The Times pointed out.

Democrats have already set a precedent of following Steyer. In July, 2016, The Democratic Party Platform absorbed Steyer’s personal goal to destroy the U.S. coal powered energy industry by 2050.

Steyer has long used his deep pockets to project his own agenda on politicians. He was the largest donor during the 2014 election as well, where he spent more than $74 million attacking the Koch brothers and trying to make climate change a “top-tier” campaign issue, The Guardian found.

In the past year, Steyer has signaled he may be expanding his advocacy to include more left-wing policies than just climate change. He told Politico in June 2017 he planned to spend $7.5 million to organize young voters leading up to the 2018 midterm elections.

Steyer’s NextGen Climate PAC was also rebranded as NextGen America sometime after mid-July 2017. The name change signaled a broader focus on liberal agenda items, and even the website now advertises a “broader plan of resistance.”

Whereas NextGen Climate had “worked to prevent damage to our climate by transitioning to a clean energy economy,” NextGen America is intends to “step up the fight for immigration rights, affordable health care, and core American values.”

Despite his previous environmental lip service, Steyer’s hedge fund, Farallon Capital Management, profited from coal investments up until 2014. In a September, 2015, interview, Steyer tried to claim he first became passionate about climate change between 2002 and 2004 -- 10 years before his company divested.

In 2015, Steyer was listed as the “manager” of a solar power company which could benefit from the climate lobbying he does. The company, Kilowatt Financial, was founded in 2011 -- the same year Steyer began directly attacking the coal industry.

Soros-Funded ProPublica Enters Local Journalism Market

2017-10-11

A George Soros-funded nonprofit is seeking to help fill the local journalism void, by bringing more liberal journalism to town. Starting with Illinois.

Nonprofit outlet ProPublica announced a new “Local Reporting Network” initiative to fund up to six journalists for one year in cities with populations below 1 million, starting in January, 2018. ProPublica has received millions of dollars from Soros, the Knight Foundation and others. It’s founding grant came from liberal Herbert Sander, who also funded the left-leaning Center for American Progress.

On Oct. 5, 2017, ProPublica asked interested newsrooms to submit an in-depth project proposal that fits within ProPublica’s aim “to spur change through stories with moral force.”

The Local Reporting Network is just the latest local journalism project launched by ProPublica. Earlier in 2017, the liberal nonprofit launched ProPublica Illinois, “an independent, nonprofit newsroom” which intends to bring ProPublica’s “collaborative model” to the state level.

Although the reporters chosen for the Local Reporting Network stay with their local newsrooms, ProPublica made clear it would provide “extensive guidance and support” to the project. That, coupled with ProPublica’s liberal donors and the fact that “entries will be judged by ProPublica editors” means ProPublica has ample opportunity to insert its own liberal bias.

After all, ProPublica launched the “Documenting Hate” project in January 2017 to “build authoritative data on hate crimes and bias incidents.” Partners included the anti-conservative Southern Poverty Law Center, which targeted the right through its “Hate Map,” Univision and Buzzfeed. None of the 21 partners were conservative.

ProPublica president Richard Tofel also defended Buzzfeed on Twitter for releasing an unverified Russian dossier in January, 2017 that attacked President Donald Trump. CNBC Special Correspondent Scott Cohn called the dossier gossip and said“throwing out raw information just to see what sticks is not journalism.”

When the IRS targeted conservative groups in 2012, ProPublica helped by releasing reports against more than 14 conservative groups like Crossroads GPS, Americans for Prosperity and the Republican Jewish Coalition. Only one liberal group was targeted.

The Local Reporting Network project was funded by a three-year, $3 million grant, the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) stated on Oct. 5, 2017. Neither ProPublica nor CJR disclosed where the donation came from. However ProPublica has received millions from left-wing donors like billionaire George Soros, the Ford Foundation, the Knight Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation.

Though ProPublica did not list which editors would be judging entries, many ProPublica editors are linked to other liberal media outlets and donors.

Senior Editors Daniel Golden and Lawrence Roberts were both former Bloomberg editors. During the 2016 campaign, the Bloomberg media empire repeatedly pushed liberal policies like gun control, destroying the coal industry and funding abortion.

ProPublica research editor Derek Kravitz meanwhile was a postgraduate research scholar at the Soros-funded Columbia University, and currently “teaches investigative reporting at Columbia’s Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism,” according to his bio.

Other editors including Tracy Weber and Robin Fields formerly worked for or with the Los Angeles Times which launched an ongoing anti-fossil fuel attack on Exxon Mobil in 2015. The LATimes reporting was funded by Soros, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Family Fund.

ProPublica stated Klein College of Media and Communication dean David Boardman would also “advise” those picking the winning entries. Boardman is closely connected to several Soros-funded organizations.

He is chair of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which received $37,300 from Soros. He is also a board member for Fund for Investigative Journalism (FIG) and Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). Soros gave FIG $400,000 in the early 2000s and $more than $49,000 to OCCRP in 2013. And Boardman is president and board member of Investigative Reporters and Editors which got $130,000 from Soros in 2012.

Networks Ignore Study Showing Faulty Climate Assumptions In Paris Agreement

2017-09-21

The broadcast networks were in an uproar in June when President Donald Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, but omitted a new study showing Paris Agreement predictions overstated Earth’s warming.

Climate scientists from Oxford and other universities published a study Sept. 18 in the peer-reviewed Nature Geoscience magazine, revealing an “important discrepancy” between climate change models compared to measured temperature data.

“Climate change poses less of an immediate threat to the planet than previously thought because scientists got their modelling wrong,” The Telegraph reported summarizing the new study on Sept. 18.

The model used for warming predictions cited by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement was faulty, according to the new research. If it had been correct, “the world ought now to be 1.3 degrees above the mid-19th-Century average, whereas the most recent observations suggest it is actually between 0.9 to 1 degree above,” The Telegraph wrote.

ABC, NBC and CBS all panicked on June 1 after Trump announced the U.S. would exit the Paris climate agreement signed by former President Barack Obama. That is all the more reason the broadcast network news shows should have reported this new research. But between Sept. 18 and Sept. 20, none of the network morning or evening news shows covered the study about the faulty forecasting used in Paris.

The networks’ one-sided approach to climate news is long-standing. After Al Gore’s Inconvenient Truth film was released in 2007, network coverage of “extreme weather” spiked by nearly 1,000 percent. And despite warnings that linking “extreme weather” and “climate change” was “controversial,” the media did it anyway.

In addition to the networks, most U.S. media outlets ignored the new peer-reviewed study and its findings. MRC Business was unable to find it mentioned by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today or The Huffington Post.

Quartz Media and The Washington Post weretwo of the exceptions to the near silence.

On Sept. 18, the Post wrote that the study suggested “humanity could have considerably more time than previously thought to avoid a ‘dangerous’ level of global warming.”

A Post op-ed on Sept. 19, used the study to mock climate change skeptics, saying the study proved “the scientific establishment is not corrupt.” “So much for the climate change ‘hoax,’” its headline read.

In addition to The Telegraph (UK), other British and European press including The Independent, The Guardian, The Sun, The Times UK and BBC covered the story.

Methodology: MRC Business searched nexis for mentions of the Nature climate change model report on broadcast network morning and evening news shows from Sept. 18 to Sept. 20. No mentions were found.

Left-Wing SPLC Donations Multiply as J.P. Morgan, Clooneys Give $2.5 Million

2017-08-22

Apple’s $1 million donation to the anti-conservative Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) was just the beginning.

Two more groups, J.P. Morgan Chase bank and the Clooney Foundation for Justice, recently announced they would pledged their own millions to that left-wing organization. The SPLC has labeled conservative groups as “hate” organizations and put them on its Hate Map. That designation prompted a shooting at one conservative organization in 2012.

Apparently, the SPLC’s dangerous history of smearing conservative groups like the Family Research Council (FRC) and the American Family Association as “hate groups,” weren’t a deterrent for J.P Morgan Chase or George and Amal Clooney.

“JPMorgan Chase is pledging $1 million, to be split between the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) to further their work in tracking, exposing and fighting hate groups and other extremist organizations across the country,” the company’s head of corporate responsibility Peter Scher wrote in an Aug. 21, memo to staff.
