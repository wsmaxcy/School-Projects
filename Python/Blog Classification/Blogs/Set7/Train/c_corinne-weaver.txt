Celebrity Lefties Push for Dem in VA Gov Race: ‘Say No To Racism’

2017-11-06

With the gubernatorial elections for the states of Virginia and New Jersey coming up on November 7, parties are arming themselves for the last campaign stretch. Washed up liberal celebrity were only too happy to volunteer for the job.

The extremely partisan effort to get citizens to vote used footage from the Charlottesville riot from August to get their message out: “say no to white supremacists.” Comedienne Wanda Sykes and actor John Leguizamo joined forces to create a PSA for the Democratic candidate, Ralph Northam. Sykes called the Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie, “complicit” in Trump’s “fail[ure] to condemn” white supremacy.

Other actors in Hollywood pushed for Northam, with angry activist Chelsea Handler stating that Russian bots “are already interfering with Virginia's election. Spreading disinformation and race baiting.” Actress Piper Perabo tweeted multiple times, telling people to vote for “gun sense” by voting for Northam and other Democrats.



Actress Alyssa Milano, the same one who claimed she was non-partisan and “had no politics,” is encouraging her followers to find a place to vote….for Northam. Actress Elizabeth Banks, (Hunger Games, The Lego Movie) shared Wanda Sykes’ PSA and encouraged people to vote Democrat. She was joined by Debra Messing and Steve Pasquale, who both told people to vote blue in Virginia.

Director Ava DuVernay brought up the Charlottesville incident, attempting to hold Gillespie accountable for Trump’s words: “‘Very fine people on both sides.’ He said that. Meant that. Virginia, it's your time to talk back thru your votes.”

Julianne Moore tweeted, “Say no to racism.” In a world that follows Hollywood’s every move, one might argue that the political manipulations of actors and actresses add more strife to the divisive environment that has blossomed throughout the nation.

Hollywood Slams Prayers, Guns in Response to Shooting: ‘Vote These NRA Lovers Out’

2017-11-06

Hollywood has its standards: President Trump isn’t allowed to politicize after a terrorist attack, but after a shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, actors and actresses can shred prayers, the NRA, and the GOP to bits and pieces.

While most of the elite offered their thoughts on gun control mixed with prayers, quite a few decided to jump on the concept of “thoughts and prayers.” After Paul Ryan tweeted his condolences to the victims, actor Wil Wheaton (Star Trek: The Next Generation) tweeted at him: “The murdered victims were in a church. If prayers did anything, they'd still be alive, you worthless sack of shit.” He had tweeted earlier, “Welcome to America. It has been zero days since our last mass shooting. #FucktheNRA”

MSNBC’s Joy Reid decided to mix in a theology lesson: “Enough with the “thoughts and prayers already.” The Bible teaches us that faith without works is dead. Do something or say nothing.” Atheist Ricky Gervais threw in his two cents: “My thoughts and prayers are that people wake the fuck up.” Even pop star Katy Perry got involved, saying, “prayer without action is powerless.”

Chelsea Handler decided to blame all shootings on one political party: “Innocent people go to church on Sunday to honor their God, and while doing so, get shot in killed. What country? America. Why? Republicans.” Singer Josh Groban slammed both prayers and Republicans: “Prayers are what the victims were doing. If you respond to these attacks with prayers but no action, you are protecting the next murderer.”

Moby just went straight to the favored scapegoat: “Do you hear me #trump ? #republicans ? #nra ? Every single gun death is preventable, and every single gun death is the result of @realdonal…” Every single gun death is the result of Trump. Seems like a bit of an exaggeration.

Actress Amy Brenneman tweeted, “Vote. These. NRA lovers. Out.” Director Adam McKay went a bit further, claiming that the shooter must have been a member of the Republican party: “Another part of the problem is that Repub Party doesn’t view mentally ill heavily armed white guys as dangerous, they view them as voters.” Rosie O’Donnell attacked the NRA, saying, “when we will end the NRA strangle hold on congress #evilNRA”

It’s interesting that guns are to blame here, since even CNN admits an armed person was able to prevent more deaths by shooting at the gunman. Because the shooter was being shot at, he dropped his weapon and ran. If all weapons were made illegal, and a shooter was targeting the same crowd, there might have been even more deaths.

Judd Apatow: Late Night Shows ‘Make Fun of People Who Are Prejudiced’

2017-11-02

Hollywood likes to think it adds something important to the political environment. Instead, it just seems to confuse people.

In a producer’s roundtable discussion hosted by The Hollywood Reporter, Judd Apatow gave late night talk shows more credibility than they deserve. He told the roundtable, “If you’ve watched people like Jon Stewart and Trevor Noah make fun of people who are prejudiced and [say] people who treat people bad are bullshitters, you might begin to form your way of reading the news.”



One might argue that The Daily Show itself is prejudiced, based on Noah’s most recent guest, Hillary Clinton. If people are drawing political opinions from a show that told Clinton that “in one world, you won,” or from a show host who told his audience, post-Trump election, that he was “shitting my pants,” then there might be a real problem with entertainment.  

In trying to bring political relevance to his own film projects, Apatow first downplayed his projects, saying: “I don’t know if one movie rocks the world in such a way that people go, “Wait a second, I don’t like Trump.””

But the marketing pitch for his project kicked in and came out strong, when he stated, “I hope that if people see The Big Sick, they might think, “I don’t know that much about a lot of the people who immigrate to this country, and maybe I could tune in a little bit and be more compassionate.”” He continued, “all we were trying to do is humanize these people who live in the United States, and suddenly that became a political act.”

What about when Apatow called living with Trump as president like being “a person about to get raped?” Did that humanize politics or rape victims? What about Apatow’s consistent political stance in support of Planned Parenthood? Is that humanizing the unborn?

Further on in the discussion, when Matthew Belloni brought up Weinstein and what Hollywood needs to do in order to prevent powerful producers from taking advantage of dozens of people, Seth Rogen took the opportunity to brag about only working with Weinstein once: “I worked with him once a decade ago, and I was like, “This is a bad dude. I’m never going to work with him ever again.” If that was the case, then why didn’t Rogen make a statement about it?

He almost indirectly addressed that later on, when he said, “There’s just a lot of people who, for lack of a better word, are pieces of shit, and people just keep working with them. Because they’re just like, “Well, it’s a necessary evil. It’s what you got to do.”

LGBT Publication Knew the Spacey/Rapp Story, Refused to Report It

2017-11-02

Hollywood’s biggest open secret is quickly unraveling. The sexual predators aren’t the only ones responsible: the media was at least complicit in hiding their crimes.

Bruce Steele, of the Asheville Citizen-Times, wrote in a personal essay that the LGBT magazine The Advocate knew that Kevin Spacey sexually harassed a 14-year old as early as the 1990’s, and still did nothing. Although the magazine published a version of the encounter in 2001, Kevin Spacey was not mentioned anywhere.

Steele wrote, “Many close friends knew of Rapp’s encounter with the actor in the 1980s, including some of us in the media.” The justification used was that there was “no parade of additional accusers” and so therefore, there was no reason to report it.

But for some reason, Steele found “some solace that the reporting of Rapp’s story led immediately to Spacey’s long delayed coming out.” In what world is that revelation comforting, that a man who stands accused of making sexual advances on a 14-year-old boy comes out as gay? Yet this isn’t just Steele’s opinion. The media’s first reaction to the breaking story of Spacey’s pedophilic behavior was of the same vein.

However, Steele made it clear: the media was in fact to blame in some ways for allowing these sexual abuses to continue for so many decades. “The result all these revelations, and the decades of backstory about what is told and what is withheld, both in Spacey’s case and in Weinstein’s and so many others, should be a moral reckoning for the media.”

But even so, Steele doesn’t want people to blame the media for what they didn’t do: expose sexual predators to the light of justice by publishing the claims of victims. Instead, he “hopes with concrete results about what we can do in 2017.”

Actress: Trump Jr.’s Socialism Joke Is Based on ‘Extreme Privilege’ and ‘Whiteness’

2017-11-01

Halloween is when kids dress up in costume and parents share cute pictures of their kids on social media. Leave it to bitter liberal Hollywood to ruin one child’s picture.

Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a photo of his daughter, Chloe, with the caption, “I’m going to take half of Chloe’s candy tonight and give it to some kid who sat at home. It’s never to early to teach her about socialism.” Socialist Hollywood was quick to jump on this statement, retweeting the child’s picture and the caption with their own views. Amber Tamblyn, the actress who declared war on conservatives, called the picture and the caption “whiteness,” saying that “it’s beyond commentary on socialism. It’s a viewpoint only extreme privilege can afford.”

Disagreeing with socialism is apparently “extreme privilege.” At least, according to the privileged, Hollywood elite, exemplified in Amber Tamblyn.

She’s not alone. A few days ago, Vogue slammed the children’s costumes as “particularly tone deaf,” and justified their criticism by assuming that Trump Jr.’s grandchildren couldn’t have possibly picked out their costumes, which were police and military outfits. The magazine then accused Trump Jr. of politicizing Halloween. Really? In a media environment where people were told dressing their children as Moana and Elsa was racist, only Trump Jr. was guilty of politicizing Halloween?

Mia Farrow, J.K. Rowling, Chris Meloni, Kumail Nanjiani, director Adam McKay, and singer Mikel Jollett all retweeted the picture of the 3-year old girl holding her Halloween candy and defended their beloved socialism as if their lives depended on it. Judd Apatow retweeted it with the caption: “We don’t need a joke. You are just an awful human being and one day God will judge you.” Were you referring to the child or the father, Apatow? Because God also judges participating in attacking innocent children on the internet.

Ricky Gervais even retweeted it, twice, with his own two cents: “He’s only joking. He’d never really teach her that sharing is a good thing.” Padma Lakshmi’s kids apparently donated all their candy, at least, so her tweet implied: “Some of us went trick or treating with a unicef box donation box.” Musician Steve Kazee tweeted, “Maybe hold off on scolding other Americans.” But as someone replied to Kazee, it’s ok to scold if you are Steve Kazee, but not Donald Trump Jr.

The Trump children and grandchildren have been targeted consistently by the left. Even Kathy Griffin admitted that she has jokes in her new stand-up tour that target 11-year old Barron Trump. Hollywood isn’t pro-children, which, considering its pro-abortion stance, should come as no surprise.

Newsweek Headline: ‘People Will Die If Trump Kills ObamaCare’

2017-11-01

Hollywood will do anything to clutch onto the last shreds of the Obama administration. Just ask Alyssa Milano.

Newsweek reported that actress Alyssa Milano, former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and actor Bradley Whitford are out to sell ObamaCare. Or as Newsweek puts it: “Get people signed up for insurance through healthcare.gov, even as President Donald Trump tries to get ObamaCare to flatline.”

Sebelius told Newsweek that people will die if they don’t sign up for ObamaCare: “I don’t think there’s any question that if people lose their insurance coverage, there will definitely be some preventable deaths.” Is that how she is trying to sell it?

Here’s the Newsweek headline from the website: “People Will Die If Trump Kills Obamacare, So Get it While You Can, These Big Names Say.” 

Alyssa Milano preached a conspiracy theory: “It’s quite clear that Trump and his friends in Washington don’t want people to sign up for healthcare. That’s why they’ve taken so many steps to make sure people don’t get the information they need to enroll. We can make sure they don’t get what they want. We can make sure people get the facts and sign up for affordable health coverage.”

What facts? Fortune reported that ObamaCare Plans are far too expensive for the middle class to afford. According to Fortune “middle-income families are being forced to pay a lot, if not most, of the premiums themselves. They are not just expensive, they are overpriced for what you get.” Affordable only if you make millions and avoid paying taxes, right Alyssa?

Part of the reason so many people voted for Trump was because they were sick of paying so much money for healthcare.

Glamour Names Sharia Law Apologist Linda Sarsour ‘Woman of the Year’

2017-10-31

How does defending sharia law translate into feminist intersectionality? For the Women’s March, it’s a key part of their work.

Glamour Magazine is willing to buy into this fake intersectionality. The latest issue, named Linda Sarsour one of its Glamour 2017 Women of the Year. As a co-chair of the Women’s March, Sarsour has been honored by Time Magazine and defended by the New York Times as a target of “right-wing hate.” But no one has pointed out that Sarsour has actually promoted Sharia law as beneficial.



Not only that, Sarsour has vehemently gone after women who have spoken out against Sharia Law, like Brigitte Gabriel and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, saying that they deserved “an ass whooping” and “their vaginas taken away” for making “front page covers and shit.” (Classy, isn’t she?) What makes this even worse is that Ali is actually a victim of female genital mutilation.

The Women’s March was all about “intersectionality,” according to Glamour. (That is, the pooling of the angry complaints of various grievance groups into a single, cacophonous whine aimed at the only real enemy: straight white males.) The co-chairs, including Sarsour, “put most everything else in their lives on hold, working around the clock to build websites and marketing materials and, most of all, to make sure intersectionality was a feature, not a bug.” But the Women’s March wouldn’t let pro-life groups march at the event, so was there intersectionality?

Glamour painted the Soros-funded Women’s March in the brightest, most woke light possible: “Soon [Teresa] Shook and [Bob] Bland joined forces, attracting the attention of thousands who were angry that voters had elected a race-baiting white man hostile to issues like reproductive rights, civil rights, and fair pay.”  

Even CNN’s Jake Tapper got into a well-documented disagreement with Sarsour over Twitter. He called her comments to Ayaan Hirsi Ali “ugly sentiments.” But Sarsour attacked Tapper as a “member of the alt-right,” even though Tapper is Jewish, and decidedly not espousing the anti-Semitic alt-right beliefs.

But feminists know best how to turn a blind eye.

Nets Ignore Removal of Washington Memorial Plaque From Historic Church

2017-10-31

What’s more important? Preserving our country’s history or somebody’s feelings?

The historic Christ Church, an Episcopalian congregation in Alexandria, Virginia, made the decision to remove plaques memorializing George Washington and Robert E. Lee from their church, even though the plaques had been there since 1870. Fueled by the politically correct trend of wiping our country’s past clean from public memory, the church told its congregation: “Today, the legacy of slavery and of the Confederacy is understood differently than it was in 1870.” The networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC, remained silent. After all, the church is giving liberal ideology exactly what it wants.

The two plaques, located in the sanctuary of the church, were donated by Mary Custis Lee, the wife of Robert E. Lee, almost 150 years ago, according to the Washington Post. While the church’s rector, the reverend Noelle York-Simmons, admitted the removal of the plaques had been discussed for several years, “the matter took on added urgency following events in Charlottesville.”

But Simmons would not reveal to the Post whether or not some of the parishioners wanted to keep the plaques. She stated, “I’m not going to speak for my parishioners.” And even though the main controversy centered around Robert E. Lee’s plaque, “church leaders said they thought it was important for the plaques to be considered together.” Since George Washington was a slave owner, a colonial, and, in the words of the reverend, a “complicated human being.”

In a letter put out by the church, Emily Bryan, the senior warden, stated: “The plaques in our sanctuary make some in our presence feel unsafe or unwelcome. Some visitors and guests who worship with us choose not to return because they receive an unintended message from the prominent presence of the plaques.”

However, the church isn’t removing the plaques completely. The letter also states that “The plaques will be relocated to a new home on our campus next year after a parish-wide process to identify an appropriate, dignified home that will allow us to better convey our history.”

Bette Midler on Manafort: ‘Roll Out the’ Guillotine Carts!

2017-10-30

Celebrities love being affirmed and validated. So while Hollywood is being rocked with its own sex abuse scandals around its brightest stars, plenty of has-beens are celebrating Manafort’s indictment.

All of Hillary’s biggest celebrity supporters, acting as circling sharks since November 9, 2016, spent October 30 on Twitter wildly celebrating the indictment of a former campaign manager for President Donald Trump. Singer Cher stated today: “WHY DO ALL “TRUMP” ROADS LEAD TO RUSSIA.”



Actor and activist George Takei was beyond thrilled, “There are 12 charges. It rather evokes a Xmas carol: “On the first day of charges, Mueller gave to me: Manafort on treas’nous conspiracy!”

He continued with his celebration: “It’s normally wrong to celebrate like it’s Christmas before it’s even Halloween, but dammit let’s make an exception today. #MuellerMonday.”

Bette Midler joined the party, "INDICTED!! Roll out the tumbrils!!” Tumbrils were carts that took the aristocracy to guillotines. Does Bette Midler want Trump guillotined? Apparently.

Almost alone among the revelers, Mark Ruffalo sounded a sober note and found this revelation “hard to celebrate.”

Actress Minnie Driver tweeted, “Is it still schadenfreude if it’s not happening to anyone you like?” Mia Farrow wondered why Trump “chose a person with close, complex & illegal connections.”  

Michael Moore was only too happy to crow over the indictment: “Perp walk! We need a perp walk!” Amber Tamblyn tweeted, “Who’s draining the swamp now, Donald?”

Rob Reiner, aka Meathead, thought he was so close to making Donald Trump “go away.” He tweeted, “Today we're seeing the tip of the tip of the iceberg. The sinking of America's first crime family.”

While it’s easy for these celebrities to condemn politics and celebrate over Russian links, it apparently is difficult for them to solve the out of control problem of sexual abuse in their own “backyard,” as actress Jessica Chastain rebuked them earlier in October. It’s also telling that the American people didn’t want the candidate handpicked by Hollywood, but instead chose the alternative.

Media Slammed For Burying Kevin Spacey Allegations in 'Coming Out' Story

2017-10-30

What’s a more important story: an actor most people suspected to be gay coming out and confirming it, or an accusation of pedophilic harassment aimed at the same actor?

In the aftermath of Harvey Weinstein allegations, several male figures in Hollywood have been accused of being sexual predators. Actor Anthony Rapp, in an interview with BuzzFeed on October 29, accused actor Kevin Spacey of making sexual advances on Rapp when he was 14 and Spacey was 26. Spacey tweeted an apology, but came out as gay in his apology. ABC, Reuters, and the New York Daily News first reported the story as “Kevin Spacey Comes Out in Emotional Tweet.”



The failure of the media to immediately pick up on the bigger issue is evident: Spacey came out in an apology statement, addressing the harassment claims. The first paragraph of his apology focused on Rapp’s claims; Spacey said “I owe [Rapp] the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.”

In the second paragraph, Spacey stated: “I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man.” Somehow, this statement made headlines. Even after news sites rushed to change their headlines, the stories remain untouched: the lede for Mashable’s story is still “After years of public speculation, Kevin Spacey is out of the closet.”

                                              

The public backlash against the three news outlets was massive. CNN’s Jake Tapper tweeted: “That Kevin Spacey is gay was news in 1997. Anthony Rapp’s announcement is news in 2017.” Journalist Glenn Greenwald tweeted, “Kevin Spacey has immense wealth & fame, and yet never came out as a gay man until he needed a distraction from this story -& sympathy.” The headlines for ABC’s story on Spacey were quickly changed to incorporate the pedophilia allegations.

                                          

Aisling Bea, a standup comedian, stated that she was not surprised: “I don’t know many actors from my era of drama school graduates who don’t have a Kevin Spacey story. The surprise is the lack of surprise.” The real question is: who else was harassed by Spacey?

Gawker reported back in March a string of emails from anonymous sources, with stories that were disturbing. According to one email, Spacey was such an insistent harasser on the set of films that the staff had to take action: “He repeatedly propositioned one of the PAs so relentlessly that they actually had to reassign the kid to another project, and then Spacey just started in on someone else. She said they eventually just made sure any “underling” position that came into contact with Spacey was staffed by a woman or an older guy — he just basically assumed he was entitled to young, decent-looking guy he had any power over on the set, straight or gay.”

Spacey was also a close friend of former president Bill Clinton, by his own confession. In an interview with Charlie Rose in 2013, the actor stated: “I did great number of things for him either at the White House or for the Democratic Party … I never waited to see which way the wind was gonna blow with respect to him. I was always there. And I was a true friend. And never doubted him, never stopped believing in him. Thought he was an extraordinary man.” Spacey is an outspoken lefty, consistently slamming the GOP and supporting Democratic candidates. According to OpenSecrets.org, he has donated to only Democratic candidates in the past 20 years.
