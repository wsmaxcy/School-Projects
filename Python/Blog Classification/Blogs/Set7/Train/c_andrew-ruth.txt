Bi-Partisan Lawmakers To Introduce Bill In Light Of Congressional Sexual Harassment Settlements

2017-11-28

A bi-partisan group of House members will introduce a bill that will force the House of Representatives to reveal which members have settled harassment allegations using taxpayer dollars.

Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis’s official website posted a statement on Monday saying he was working with other members to draft such a bill.

Since 1995, more than $15 million in taxpayer dollars has been paid out to settle claims, including sexual harassment claims, on behalf of members of Congress and congressional staff.  While the amount of money paid is public, everything else is secret.  The public doesn’t know which members have been involved in taxpayer-financed settlements for alleged misconduct.

I’m working on legislation to unseal the settlement records, bar the use of tax dollars to pay harassment claims against members and staff, prohibit members from using their office budgets to camouflage settlement payments, and require reimbursement of the taxpayer by members and staff who have had settlements paid due to their misconduct.
This bill is a no-brainer following the revelations earlier this month that Michigan Democratic Rep. John Conyers — also, the longest-serving member of Congress — paid out taxpayer monies to settle multiple sexual harassment claims over the years.

Trump Tweets Matter: Britain’s House Of Commons Raises Point Of Order Over Early Morning Tweet

2017-11-29

Throughout Donald Trump’s candidacy and subsequent presidency, many have argued over whether or not Trump’s tweets matter.

As the White House has since declared tweets from both @RealDonaldJTrump and the official @POTUS account are official statements from the president, it should be clear to anyone that his tweets do matter.

And they clearly matter and are a point of concern to our closest ally, particularly in light of an early morning retweet from the President of a Britain First leader, which my colleague, Neil Stevens, covered earlier.

Members of Britain’s House of Commons raised a point of order on Wednesday in outrage over Trump giving such a “massive platform” to a woman convicted of hate speech in Britain.



The Home Secretary has so far declined to comment on Trump’s tweet.

Commentary’s Noah Rothman summed up the incident well in a single sentence on Twitter.

“Hey this is great. An international incident with our closest geostrategic ally. Just keep telling yourself Trump’s tweets don’t matter.”

Indeed. Unfortunately, as we’ve learned in the past two years, there’s little anyone can do about the President of the United States’ use of his personal account short of Twitter deciding to shut down his account, and that has almost no chance of happening.

Girl Guides To Allow Males To Shower With Girls As Young As 5

2017-11-28


What could go wrong?

The U.K.’s 107-year-old version of Girl Scouts, Girl Guides, has advised group leaders to allow boys who identify as girls to use the same bathroom facilities (including showers and changing rooms) as biological girls.

This goes for any member of Girl Guides, which ranges in ages from 5 to 25.

Girlguiding’s official guidance instructs guide leaders to allow members who were born male but now identify as female to share changing rooms, toilets and sleeping quarters with girls when away on excursions.
Why? Because “the use of gendered facilities,” including showers, toilets and changing rooms, “can cause anxiety”.

Of course, if an actual 8 or 15-year-old girl doesn’t want to shower or change in the same room as a 9 or 16-year-old with a penis, that’s her problem. The girls who have anxiety about sharing facilities which are inherently a place of vulnerability are now made to request separate facilities…but it’s not guaranteed they’ll get them.

“If a young person doesn’t feel comfortable sharing accommodation, for whatever reason, we encourage them to talk to their leader about alternative accommodation and facilities.”
Parents won’t have to worry beforehand, however. Girl Guides also advised that informing parents that a trans person will be at a “residential event” is not “best practice.”

Lovely.

So now an organization parents have sent their girls to for a century and feeling it is a safe place for their young girls now have no ability to protect them from possible trauma or experience a child or teen is unprepared for.

At least one government official has seen how misguided the new policy is:

Conservative MP for Monmouth in South Wales David Davies provided an ounce of logic to the insanity, blasting the trans move by the organization.

“If transgender girls who are physically male are going to be sharing facilities, it’s going to make some girls threatened and uncomfortable and the Guides shouldn’t be doing that,” he said.
Girl Guides is filled with girls at vulnerable stages of life, including adolescence and emerging adulthood. We have yet to truly understand the psychology of gender dysphoria, but I think it’s safe to say throwing boys and girls together in showers isn’t societal best practice either.

Sacrificing the mental and physical well-being of children at the altar of political correctness when there’s nothing to show it’s a healthy practice is absurd.

Current Political Climate Necessitates Ridiculous Joint Statement

2017-11-28

Only in times like these would we see a public statement from two consening adults about a decade-old consensual sexual relationship that went south.

In a court filing from 2008, Rep. Al Green (D – Texas) and his former district director, Lucinda Daniels, enagaged in a sexual relationship.

The relationship soured and Daniels reportedly claimed she endured a hostile work environment and sexual harassment working for Green and threatened to make the affair public.

According to court documents, Daniels “threatened to go public with her complaints if the Congressman does not per her money. Green has done nothing wrong and refuses to pay ‘hush money’ just for political expediency. Green will not be extorted or blackmailed by Daniels. He will not be the victim of a shakedown by Daniels and her agents. Green demands vindication of his actions and now sues Daniels for declaratory judgment relief relating to her workplace allegations and her quest for money.”

So, two adults have a consensual affair. Things go bad. Accusations get made and lawsuits get filed and we have to hear about it a decade later. What a dumb time to be alive.

BREAKING: Trump Tells Stupid Pocahontas Joke In Front Of Native Americans

2017-11-27

Pres. Trump had a true John Kelly facepalm moment at a White House ceremony commemorating Native American codetalkers on Monday.

In front of a portrait of Andrew Jackson — of all people — Trump used his pet name for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, calling her “Pocahontas” in front of the assembled audience.

Here's the video: Trump calls Elizabeth Warren 'Pocahontas' while honoring Native American code talkers: "You were here long before any of us were here. Although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas."

“You were here long before any of us were here. Although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas,” Trump said.
Once again, the man screws up the joke, as the original nickname used for Sen. Warren following the news that she claimed Native American ancestry was “Fauxcahontas.

John McCain To Hillary Clinton: Find Something To Do

2017-11-27

Sen. John McCain opined in an interview with Esquire on Hillary Clinton’s penchant over the past year for not letting go of her loss in the 2016 election. McCain said Hillary has “got to move on.”

He spoke from experience saying, “One of the almost irresistible impulses you have when you lose is to somehow justify why you lost and how you were mistreated: ‘I did the right thing! I did!’ The hardest thing to do is to just shut up.”

McCain’s own memoir is scheduled for publication in April and will cover his presidential loss in 2008.

McCain also lambasted Clinton for writing her whiney election memoir, What Happened, after the election.

“What’s the f–king point? Keep the fight up? History will judge that campaign, and it’s always a period of time before they do. You’ve got to move on,” he said in the interview. “This is Hillary’s problem right now: She doesn’t have anything to do.”
Personally, I like the idea of Bill and Hillary not having much to do these days. It means they’re not engaging in their previous decades of machinations. Even the fluff pieces on daughter Chelsea seem to have subsided in recent months.

Too Little Too Late? Trump Won’t Campaign For Roy Moore

2017-11-27

A White House official confirmed Monday that President Trump will not campaign for controversial GOP candidate Roy Moore prior to Alabama’s special election on Dec. 12.

BREAKING: White House official: Trump will not campaign for embattled Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore before Dec. 12 election.
But given Trump’s past statements questioning Moore’s accusers, it seems a lot like closing the barn door after the livestock already ran off.

Trump has had weeks and ample opportunity to pressure Moore to drop out as the Senate candidate as allegations against him sexually harassing, abusing and pursuing minors continue to mount.

The time has unfortunately passed for Trump to make any real impact on the election by allowing an alternate candidate to step in. Leaving Republicans in the uncomfortable position of voting for Moore or seeing a Democrat take the seat.

Congressional Hispanic Caucus Bars Republican From Joining

2017-11-21

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus voted to keep Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo from joining the all-Democrat organization last week and many in the Hispanic community are crying foul, as they should.

Curbelo took to Twitter to vent his irritation and frustration with the group’s bigoted vote.

 
Carlos Curbelo

@carloslcurbelo
Don't miss this pathetic attempt by the @HispanicCaucus to justify discrimination, bigotry, and intolerance against a fellow Hispanic. Whatever happened to the values of diversity and inclusion? Truly shameful.

ABC and CNN political commentator Ana Navarro joined in tweeting her dismay at the vote:

 
Ana Navarro

@ananavarro
Disappointing. If @HispanicCaucus gonna deny membership to a Republican Hispanic, representing 1 of most Hispanic districts, who wants to work together on issues affecting community, they should just call themselves “El Caucus Demócrata” and call it a day. 

And attorney and CNN contributor, Raul Reyes, wrote at The Hill:

This whole episode makes everyone involved look partisan and petty. By keeping Curbelo out, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus appears to be acting in its own interests, rather than those of Hispanic Americans. This is a sad example of how infighting among Latinos keeps our community from moving forward together.
Curbelo notes that Hispanic Republicans in Congress left the CHC in 2003 and created the Congressional Hispanic Conference. However, he’s correct that this kind of thing makes everyone look petty and small.

Particularly in light of Curbelo’s moderate Republican views.

In some respects, Curbelo is not your typical Republican. He has advocated on behalf of undocumented immigrant youth and recipients of Temporary Protected Status. He believes in climate change, and co-founded the House Climate Solutions Caucus. He says he was the firstRepublican lawmaker to publicly discuss impeaching President Trump. He has applauded the appointment of Robert Mueller as Special Counsel to investigate potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The business of segregating along racial lines in Congress is a truly bizarre thing in 2017. But, I get it. Identity politics have been foisted upon us as the gains of the Civil Rights Movement fade from memory.

One can only wish more congressmen and women would join Sen. Tim Scott (R – S.C.), one of two African American senators, and choose to not join such antiquated organizations that only serve to divide and keep members of Congress from working together based purely on race.

Unreal: Women Of SNL Give Al Franken A Pass

2017-11-21

The women of Saturday Night Live are giving Sen. Al Franken a pass on his blatant sexual harassment that came to light last week.

Sending support and gratitude to Al Franken rather than the woman there is photographic proof he humiliated, demeaned and sexually harassed? Unreal.

I can’t say it’s at all surprising that these women are answering the call to circle the wagons around Franken as calls for the former comedian have come from all sides that he out to step down.

This is a big indication of what many expected to happen is already occurring and Franken won’t face any consequences or be held accountable for his actions.

Of course, what happens with Franken will have a ripple effect if Roy Moore is elected to the Senate next month. Democrats and Republicans will both point fingers at the other side keeping/allowing sexual harassers and predators among their ranks.

Neither side will want to be the first to blink and we’ll have Sen. Al Franken and Roy Moore as respective heads of their party’s Creeper Club.

Watch: Ben Sasse Had A Few Words To Say To Reporters About Growing Political Tribalism

2017-11-20

Sen. Ben Sasse (R – Neb.) took a moment to speak to reporters in Iowa on Saturday at The Family Leader’s Celebrate the Family event and responded to a question about making speeches to likeminded individuals.

Sasse responded with a perfect summary of American political life and what’s happening with the growing polarization and tribalism of American political life.

Sasse said:

“I think that neighborhoods are often not comprised of people who are likeminded. Neighbors at coffee shops in Fairmont, Nebraska, the 25,000 person farm town I’m from three hours from here, lots and lots of people differ on policy debates. They just don’t think policy defines the line between good and evil.

They think that raising your kids to play sports right and with honor and integrity and respect, and to get your math homework done on time, and to be the kind of neighbors people want to have living next door to you, all of those textured communal things, are more important than our political tribes.

The problem is, as people are more and more mobile and less and less anchored at any one place political tribes tries to fill in a lot of that meeting. It won’t work.

You can’t fix what’s broken in American politics with more politics. Most of what matters in American life and most of what’s broken in American life is cultural stuff well upstream from politics.

And we have a lot of people right now who are trying to take this crisis of loneliness and placelessness and work disruption and try to fill in political answers. Politics aren’t smart enough to fix the diversity of texture of all that’s troubled right now.”
Again, Sasse gets down to the issue in question by pointing out the growing gap between Right and Left in the country is a symptom of what’s going on in other areas of American life.

Politics as filler for a much more mobile and less rooted society is something we still have yet to resolve in the age of global instant communication.
