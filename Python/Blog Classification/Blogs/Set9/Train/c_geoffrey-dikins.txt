STUDY: Nets Covered Donald Jr’s Russia Meeting 20x More Than Clinton Uranium Deal

2017-07-13

The Big Three (ABC, CBS, NBC) evening news shows, in the last four nights, have been dominated by Donald J. Trump Jr.’s 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower – a meeting in which apparently no favors, money or meaningful information was exchanged – but those same shows all but ignored Hillary Clinton’s Russia-Uranium scandal back in 2015. 

Author Peter Schweizer, in his 2015 book Clinton Cash, broke the story that a Canadian uranium company, seeking approval of a sale to the Russian government from then Secretary of State Clinton’s State Department, had donated millions to the Clinton Foundation.

At the time, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was considered the favorite to win the Democratic nomination but the networks couldn’t care less. Total amount of Big Three evening news network coverage of that story in over two years? Just 3 minutes and 1 second. 

However, in just four nights the Big Three networks have swamped their evening news shows with 62 minutes and 18 seconds of Donald Trump Jr. coverage, or 20 times more than what they devoted to the Clinton Foundation uranium deal scandal.  



So far CBS Evening News has devoted the most amount of time to Trump Jr.’s meeting (25 minutes, 20 seconds), followed by ABC’s World News Tonight (22 minutes, 24 seconds) and then NBC Nightly News at 14 minutes, 34 seconds. 

In contrast, since April 23, 2015 the NBC Nightly News has spent a grand total of 92 seconds on the Uranium-Russia deal. The CBS Evening News devoted a total of 61 seconds on the Schweizer revelations, followed by ABC World News Tonight at just a mere 28 seconds of coverage. 

On the April 23, 2015 NBC Nightly News, correspondent Andrea Mitchell reported: “When she took office, Hillary Clinton, pressed by the White House, agreed to a memo voluntarily disclosing foreign contributions. But the upcoming book Clinton Cash, obtained by NBC News, claims she did not live up to that promise. For example, while Secretary Clinton was trying to reset relations with Russia, the book describes how Russia`s nuclear agency Rosatom gained control of a U.S. uranium company. The author, former George W. Bush aide Peter Schweizer writes, shortly after the Rosatom deal was announced, Bill Clinton was in Moscow for a particularly well-compensated speech. He was paid five hundred thousand dollars, from another Russian entity.”

Mitchell continued: “And the book claims, however hawkish Hillary might have been on other deals, this one sailed through. The Russian purchase of Uranium One was approved. The author asks, why the apparent reversal? Could it be because shareholders involved in the transactions had transferred approximately one hundred forty-five million dollars to the Clinton Foundation or its initiatives? Republicans are pouncing.”

Mitchell laid out a damning set of facts, but the NBC Nightly News has never again mentioned the scandal. 

Over on the April 23, 2015 ABC World News Tonight, correspondent Cecilia Vega briefly relayed The New York Times version of the uranium story: “Report after report questioning foreign donations it [The Clinton Foundation] scandal accepted while Clinton was Secretary of State. The New York Times reporting that, as Clinton State Department was signing off on the sale of one of America’s largest uranium mines to Russia, the mine’s chairman used his family’s charity to donate more than $2 million to the Clinton Foundation. And despite promises of transparency, those donations never disclosed.” 

That brief mention, more than two years ago, is all the coverage this story has received on ABC World News Tonight. 

CBS Evening News didn’t arrive on the uranium story until March 29, 2017 and then it was only to knock down President Donald Trump’s claims, as anchor Scott Pelley reported the following: “Well, today, President Trump sowed confusion on the Russia investigation. He asked why the media are not covering, quote, ‘Money from Russia to Clinton for the sale of uranium?’ Well, here’s why, no credible source alleges that Hillary Clinton was paid by Russia for American uranium. But like most conspiracy theories, there is an atom of truth in this. By 2013, a Russian company purchased twenty percent of American uranium deposits. That was approved by a committee, including Clinton’s State Department, but also including the Departments of Treasury, Justice, Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Energy, plus the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Office of Science and Technology. Separately, the deal was okayed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Secretary Clinton could not have stopped the deal.”

Schweizer countered that argument and more when he broke down the connections in a March 3, 2017 FoxNews.com article: 

Then there is the glaring fact that the Clinton Foundation also scored $145 million in donations from nine shareholders in a Canadian uranium company called Uranium One that was sold to the Russian government in 2010. The deal required the approval of several federal government agencies, including Hillary Clinton’s State Department. The deal allowed Rosatom, the Russian State Nuclear Agency, to buy assets that amounted to 20 percent of American uranium.  Rosatom, by the way controls the Russian nuclear arsenal.

Equally troubling: some of those donations were hidden and not disclosed by the Clintons. President Obama required the Clinton Foundation to disclose all contributions as a condition of Hillary Clinton becoming Secretary of State. But that did not happen. The only reason the hidden donations ever came to light is because we uncovered them by combing through Canadian tax records.

Everyone got what they wanted in this deal: the uranium investors made a nice profit; the Russians acquired a strategic asset; and the Clinton Foundation bagged a lot of money.

Hillary Clinton says she was not involved in the decision to approve the sale of Uranium One.  As proof, the Clinton campaign in 2015 trotted out her former aide, Assistant Secretary of State Fernandez, to say publicly that we should take his word for it that she was not involved in approving that deal. But as we now know from the leaked Podesta emails, Fernandez was all too eager to help Podesta kill the story, while getting other favors from Podesta.  That raises questions about the veracity of his comments.

Sick! No Criticism on Nets for Elizabeth Warren’s ‘Blood Money’ Attack

2017-07-23

So much for those calls for civility in the wake of the shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise. On Thursday, Democratic Senator and progressive hero Elizabeth Warren disgustingly accused the Republicans of funding their health care bill with “blood money” and  “paying for tax cuts with American lives.” 

Surely the Big Three (ABC, CBS, NBC) networks would condemn such language in this new era of civility right? Well not exactly.

So far there have been ZERO statements condemning Warren’s words on the Big Three evening or morning shows. In fact, neither ABC or CBS has yet to report on Warren’s remarks. 

There has been a total of only 21 seconds devoted to Warren’s comments delivered from the well of the Senate and on the Massachusett’s senator’s Twitter account. On Thursday’s NBC Nightly News, correspondent Kasie Hunt ran a 14 second clip of Warren’s remarks, without any soundbites critical of the Senator. 

Correspondent Peter Alexander devoted 7 seconds to the Warren comments on Friday’s Today show. Alexander did not air any challenges to Warren, but actually characterized her stance as “defiant”: 

PETER ALEXANDER: On Capitol Hill more than 40 people, some in wheelchairs arrested and dragged from outside the office of the Senate Republican leader. Democrats, defiant.

SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: These cuts are blood money. People will die. 
It should be noted all three morning shows did cover actor Johnny Depp’s threats against President Donald Trump. 

But in the wake of all the calls for civility, post-Alexandria shooting, shouldn’t a sitting senator’s attack on her fellow colleagues be taken as seriously as the rants of a past-their prime Hollywood actor?

FLASHBACK: Networks Didn’t Give a Damn When Red China Helped Clinton Win in ’96

2017-03-22

The Big Three networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) have devoted exhaustive coverage over the allegation that Russia may have interfered with the 2016 election, as most recently seen in their massive reporting of the James Comey hearings. But there was a time when they didn’t care when a foreign country tried to buy a U.S. election (Hint: It helped a Democrat).

Back in 1996, China helped then-President Bill Clinton get re-elected by funneling money to the Clinton campaign. During Clinton’s re-election campaign against Republican Bob Dole, the Chinese Red Army (via fundraiser Johnny Chung) donated $300,000 to the Clinton campaign. After Clinton won, his administration quietly approved the export of key technology that aided China’s ballistic missile program.  

Despite scoops by the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Washington Post, The Washington Times that detailed connections between Chinese contributions and espionage efforts, as well as exhaustive Congressional hearings the Big Three networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) all but buried the Clinton-Chinese fundraising scandal.  

And even when they did cover the scandal, anchors and reporters were dismissive. The late ABC World News Tonight anchor Peter Jennings, on his April 10, 1997 show, thought the investigation into the scandal wasn’t worth the effort: “When we come back, two investigations of fundraising abuse, two of them on Capitol Hill. Is it a waste of time and money?” 

When the late-Senator Fred Thompson’s Governmental Affairs Committee took up the matter in the summer of 1997, ABC correspondent Linda Douglass was quick to claim there was nothing to the investigation: “Senator [Fred] Thompson is clearly tired of taking a beating from the Democrats, who every single day point out the fact that he’s failed to prove there is any Chinese plot in connection with the Democratic presidential campaign.”

On June 17, 1997 then Today co-anchor Katie Couric absurdly asked The Washington Post’s Bob Woodward “Are members of the media, do you think, Bob, too scandal-obsessed, looking for something at every corner?”

And while today the liberal media is playing up the sinister KGB past of Vladimir Putin, back then they were offended by any labeling of China as communist or “red.” On the April 4, 1997 CBS Evening News, reporter Phil Jones huffed: “Republicans call this money ‘a direct slap at those brave young Americans who spilled their blood defending freedom.’ China is referred to as ‘Red China.’ Why not just call it ‘China’? Why ‘Red China’?”

The following are some of the major discoveries from that era and how they were or were not covered: 

■ China’s Army Funds the Democrats. On April 4, 1999 the Asian fundraising scandal culminated in a Los Angeles Times report: Johnny Chung told Justice Dept. investigators that the chief of Chinese military intelligence gave him $300,000 to donate to the Clinton campaign. None of the broadcast networks touched this bombshell until Chung appeared before Congress on May 11, but even then the ABC and NBC morning shows and the CBS Evening News ignored him.

■ China Acquires U.S. Missile Technology. Beginning in April 1998, The New York Times reported the Chinese government had been given technological expertise that “significantly advanced Beijing’s ballistic missile program,” and the head of one of the offending defense contractors was the largest individual contributor to Democrats in 1996. The number of evening news reports on this story since April 1998? ABC: 7. CBS: 3. NBC: 2. ABC outnumbered these 12 pieces in a 24-hour period highlighting their Monica Lewinsky interview.

■ China Acquires U.S. Warhead Technology. One year after that discovery, The New York Times found that the Chinese government had stolen technology from U.S. nuclear labs that would help them miniaturize their nuclear warheads. In the first ten days the Big Three aired only 11 evening stories and six morning stories, then dropped the issue. The networks have since ignored several significant revelations and conducted only one morning show interview.

■ Clinton’s Denials Exposed. When pressed by print reports about whether he knew Chinese espionage was occurring on his watch, President Clinton claimed in two press conferences that he was told nothing about espionage occurring during his term. When new print reports revealed him to be lying, the networks again refused to give viewers the evidence.

Notable Quotables Special Edition: Trashing Trump’s Cabinet

2016-12-13

So far, the liberal media have trashed Donald Trump’s cabinet choices as a “racially insensitive” group of “hard-line” “radicals” and “ignoramuses” who will bring about “environmental disaster” and “calamity to the poor.” This is a far cry from the treatment Barack Obama’s cabinet picks were given in 2008. His appointments were hailed as a diverse “mosaic,” an “all-star” team of “superstar” “geniuses” full of “brain power.” 

Obama’s picks were praised by the likes of Chris Matthews who cooed: “It’s an astounding gesture of magnanimity to take on the person [Hillary Clinton] you beat in a very tough, really eight-year fight....It’s a magnanimous gesture. It’s astounding to everyone involved.” ABC’s Robin Roberts wondered if Obama’s selections were “a team of rivals, a la President Lincoln, or is a better comparison a team of geniuses as FDR did?” And NBC’s Andrea Mitchell hyped Obama’s team as a collection of “superstars...with so much brain power.” 

But in 2016, Team Trump’s members, one-by-one, have been condemned by the liberal press. Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions, national security advisor Michael Flynn and senior adviser Stephen Bannon were attacked by Bloomberg Politics editor John Heilemann as having “a history of....racially insensitive endeavors.” NBC Today host Matt Lauer questioned if Trump’s EPA pick of Scott Pruitt was an “environmental disaster?” Dr. Ben Carson’s nomination to HUD was welcomed by a New York Times headline: “How Ben Carson Could Undo a Desegregation Effort,” while a tweet by one of its writers predicted “Carson will spell calamity for poor.” 

The following is a collection the worst of the liberal media’s vicious attacks on Trump’s cabinet picks, so far and a look back at some of the effusive praise for Obama’s nominations: 

Trump Assembling “Hard-Line” Team of “Radicals” and “Ignoramuses”...
“I wish I could say that Ben Carson was the only person who didn’t have experience in his area....What we have are ignoramuses, billionaires and a few generals....This is pretty frightful stuff. You have loads of people who have never been in government who don’t understand the difference between business and government.”
— Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin on MSNBC’s AM Joy, December 11.

“President-elect Donald J. Trump moved quickly on Friday to begin filling national security posts at the top echelons of his administration, selecting a group of hawks and campaign loyalists who reflect the hard-line views that defined his run for president.”
— New York Times article by Julie Hirschfeld Davis, November 18.

“So you have people who I would say don’t fit into exactly a team of rivals, but to many people a team of radicals.”
— Commentator Juan Williams on Fox News Sunday, November 20. 

 

...But Obama Appointed a “Hard-Headed Realist” Team of “Moderates” and “Geniuses”
Co-host Robin Roberts: “Some would say it’s a team of rivals, a la President Lincoln, or is a better comparison a team of geniuses as FDR did?”
Co-host George Stephanopoulos: “Well, one Obama advisor told me what they like is a combination of ‘Team of Rivals’ and ‘The Best and the Brightest,’ which was the David Halberstam book about the incoming Kennedy administration...We have not seen this kind of combination of star power and brain power and political muscle this early in a cabinet in our lifetimes.”
— Exchange on ABC’s Good Morning America, November 24, 2008.

“It’s also a meritocracy. These are superstars, not afraid of strong personalities — Larry Summers inside the White House — but people with so much brain power and so much education, and a combination of, of talents here.”
— Andrea Mitchell on NBC’s Meet the Press, December 21, 2008.

“Although some critics say that his all-star cabinet might be difficult to manage, Obama is determined to pick the strongest, smartest people he can find.”
— Andrea Mitchell on NBC Nightly News, November 21, 2008. 

“I think this is one of the better transitions that we’ve had....A lot of people said this is going to be a very extremist president and all that, that he’s a very liberal Democrat, but as we have seen in appointment after appointment, he’s hewing to the center. He’s picking a bunch of flaming moderates here.” 
— Face the Nation moderator Bob Schieffer to CBS’s Early Show host Harry Smith on December 4, 2008.

 

Trump Appointing Only Racist White Guys...    
“There are millions and millions of non-white Americans, who are looking at the group — not because it’s so white — but also because if you take those people together — Bannon, Flynn and Sessions — all three of them have a history of being involved at a minimum racially insensitive endeavors. Having said racially insensitive things, and to some people worse than that. So part of the thing here is that I think that’s unsettling to a large number of people....That’s a hardline group, on immigration, on foreign policy, on politics....that’s an ideological group and that’s a hardline group.”
— Bloomberg Politics editor John Heilemann on Sunday Today with Willie Geist, November 20.

 

...While Obama Created a Diverse “Mosaic” 
And what Barack Obama said, I think, was very powerful — that we’re interested in experience and in diversity and it is a mix of goals here....what this seems to be is effortless. They’re creating a mosaic, but they’re not doing it by self-consciously creating that mosaic.”
— NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC Live, December 3, 2008.

“[Barack Obama] has signaled that in the cabinet, there will be diversity, diversity of political party, of gender, of geography and of race. Today, ABC News has learned he will turn to one of his close associates to be the new attorney general. If confirmed, Eric Holder would be the first African-American to hold that post.”
— ABC’s Charles Gibson on World News, November 18, 2008.

Trump’s EPA Will Endanger Environment
Anchor Scott Pelley: “The President-elect filled more administration posts today, putting a global warming skeptic in charge of protecting the environment.”...
Nancy Cordes: “The Sierra Club said today, ‘Having Scott Pruitt in charge of the EPA is like putting an arsonist in charge of fighting fires.’” 
— CBS Evening News, December 7.

“Environmental disaster? Controversy sparked by President-elect Trump’s pick to run the EPA....The ongoing lawsuit against the very agency he’s tapped to lead. And his position on climate change putting a dark cloud over his nomination....”
— Co-host Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today, December 8. 

“He’s [Scott Pruitt] not accepting the science....Either you accept the science or you don’t....Ninety nine percent of the scientific community says that global warming is impacted by man....People thought the world was flat....People thought blacks and whites shouldn’t marry. People thought blacks shouldn’t be equal. That doesn’t mean you accept it as fact as a leader.” 
— Host Chris Cuomo on CNN’s New Day, December 8. 

“In terms of the recent EPA [Scott Pruitt] pick, the concern is that the attorney general from Oklahoma is a denier of some of the science behind global warming....Can you be for clean air and water if you do not believe that man has a hand in global warming?”
— Host Chris Cuomo’s questions to Rep. Marsha Blackburn on CNN’s New Day, December 9. 

“Why don’t they just call it the ‘Environmental Pollution Agency’ instead of the Environmental Protection Agency, because he is going to dismantle everything in place — the air you breathe, the water you drink. I mean, what he’s done in Oklahoma is not that great either....There were 907 earthquakes in Oklahoma last year and they say they were caused by the oil and gas production. How is he helping Oklahoma?”
— Co-host Joy Behar on ABC’s The View, December 8. 

 

Trump Filling Cabinet With Wall Street Pirates 
“[Trump’s] top cabinet picks come under fire for ties to bailouts and Wall Street. Critics saying this is not how you drain the swamp....”
— Co-host Savannah Guthrie on NBC’s Today, December 1.

“You know, before the election was over before election night and right after I described the Trump group as a pirate ship. Well, some of these nominees it looks like it’s a pirate yacht...”
— Political analyst Matthew Dowd on ABC’s Good Morning America, December 1. 

“Mr. Trump’s choice of Mnuchin for Treasury and billionaire businessman Wilbur Ross for Commerce signals a turning away from candidate Trump’s attacks on Wall Street corruption....”
— Correspondent Major Garrett on CBS This Morning, December 1. 

                vs.

“If one wants to bring new people, if one wants to bring new bodies, new blood, a kind of best and brightest, Tim Geithner, head of the New York Fed, really at the center of this Wall Street meltdown we’ve seen, someone with lots of experience in this particular morass, someone might be able to bring more confidence, restore confidence in the markets.” 
— New York Times editor Marcus Mabry on CBS’s Early Show, November 20, 2008.

 

Slamming Sessions
“The Transition; Trump Atty General Pick Dogged by Racism Allegations”
— Graphic on screen during CNN Newsroom with Brooke Baldwin, November 18.

“Consider the fact that you had Eric Holder, the first African-American attorney general, then follow that up with Loretta Lynch. Eric Holder making civil rights a priority, tried to rebuild the civil rights division there. Now you’ll have Jeff Sessions....he referred to organizations like the NAACP and some other civil rights groups as being, quote, ‘un-American and Communist-inspired.’ Back then, an individual said that he said that the KKK was fine until he learned that they smoked pot.”
— NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander on MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell Reports, November 18.

Co-host Paula Faris: “One thing, we looked at the hiring of Jeff Sessions for attorney general. And these were unfounded accusations from 30 years ago. That he-”
Co-host Sunny Hostin: “He’s a bigot...Somebody testified under oath that he called an African-American man a boy. He’s a bigot.”
— ABC’s The View, December 2.  

   

Flaying Flynn 
“Look, Michael Flynn — General Flynn — has made fair criticisms of how this administration dealt with the rising threat that became ISIS. But then, you jump the shark into this kind of Islamophobia — to indict — to say that Islam is a political ideology — what he has said — and not a religion; to indict four billion Muslims around the globe — I mean, that’s just — that’s just short-sighted, ignorant thinking.”
— Ex-NBC Meet the Press host David Gregory on CNN’s New Day, November 18. 

“Democrats — they’re worried that Mr. Trump has picked so many generals....Some, though, say a militarized view of America got us into — you know, the Iraq War. It created problems at Abu Ghraib. It created the mess that is now Guantanamo Bay. So, do they have a point?”
— Anchor Carol Costello to former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on CNN Newsroom, December 8. 

 

Pouncing on Puzder
“Fast-food billionaire Andrew Puzder is Trump’s pick for labor secretary, and another potentially problematic confirmation. The CEO of Carl’s Jr and Hardee’s, Puzder said raising the federal minimum wage means cutting jobs....Some Democrats called it a war on labor.”
—  Correspondent Katy Tur on NBC Nightly News, December 8. 

                
Bashing Ben
“Ben Carson, with zero housing experience, named head of HUD. Another day in the kakistocracy.”
— December 5 tweet by NBC News legal analyst Lisa Bloom. (“Kakistocracy” is a term meaning a state or country run by the worst, least qualified, or most unscrupulous citizens.)

   “Yet another calamity — contemptuous choice for critical dept. Wonder if Carson would like a housing expert to perform brain surgery on him.”...
   “Trump choice of Carson will spell calamity for poor but not just poor. It betrays utter ignorance about cities and economic development.”...
   “Those Rust Belt Trump voters who depend on depts like HUD are about to find out why they sold themselves out and their souls to the devil.”
— December 5 tweets by New York Times architecture critic Michael Kimmelman. 

“How Ben Carson Could Undo a Desegregation Effort”
— New York Times headline, November 23. 

“Carson has also complained that low-income families are too dependent on government aid. He said that it’s the American people’s job, not the government’s, to care for the needy. It’s not clear what this would mean for HUD, but advocates fear the worst — that it will lead to deep cuts in programs to reduce homelessness, and to subsidize affordable housing.”
— Correspondent Pam Fessler on National Public Radio, December 6.

STUDY: Big Three Networks Attack Comey Over Clinton by 3 to 1

2016-10-31

Ever since it was announced, on Friday, that the FBI was pursuing new leads into the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s e-mail server scandal, the Big Three (ABC, CBS, NBC) networks have gone into attack mode against James Comey, turning what should be a scandal about Clinton into a smear against the FBI director. 

Beginning with the evening (October 28) of the announcement through Monday morning (October 31) MRC analysts reviewed all statements (by reporters, analysts, and partisans) that took a position on Comey and Clinton and found arguments against Comey (88) swamped those against Clinton (31) by a ratio of almost 3 to 1. There were a handful of statements that praised either Comey (10) or Clinton (4) 

MRC analysts also discovered that the Big Three networks’ evening (ABC’s World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News) and morning show programs (ABC’s Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, NBC’s Today) devoted a total of 2 hours, 19 minutes and 49 seconds to the Comey story. 

 



 

Network anchors immediately questioned Comey. On the October 30 edition of Good Morning America co-anchor and Clinton Foundation donor George Stephanopoulos slammed Comey: “It’s hard to know what’s going through James Comey’s mind right now. Remember when he came out in July? He broke tradition back in July when he gave the press conference. Rather than simply closing the investigation, he said he was doing it because there was such intense public interest in this case. You would think that same standard would drive him to release more details.” 

CBS This Morning co-anchor Gayle King, on October 31, relayed the harsh criticism: “Former Attorney General Eric Holder, along with nearly 100 former Justice Department officials on both sides of the aisle, said that they were astonished and perplexed by Comey’s decision. Holder wrote this in the Washington Post — that he’s afraid that Comey has unintentionally hurt the public’s trust in the FBI, allowing — quote, ‘misinformation to be spread by partisans with less pure intentions.’” 

And over on NBC’s Today show Willie Geist, on October 30, peppered Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway: “This is an open investigation. It’s on the eve of an election. That’s why the DOJ recommended to Director Comey not to proceed with this letter because everyone knew it would be leaked out to the public. If you were on the other side of this, would you think this was the right thing to do on the eve of an election to be so vague about it without knowing the content?”

Rigged? Trump Doesn’t Have a Single Major Newspaper Endorsement

2017-10-18

With just three weeks to go, major newspapers (with a circulation of at least 50,000) are walloping Donald Trump in their official endorsements, favoring Hillary Clinton by a count of 68 to zero.

Out of a total of 82 newspapers that have offered an editorial on who their readers should vote for, 68 (83 percent) of them have endorsed Hillary Clinton, five (6 percent) recommended Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, two (2 percent) advised to vote for anybody but Trump and seven (9 percent) newspapers offered no endorsement at all.

While other major newspapers like The Wall Street Journal, New York Post and The Philadelphia Inquirer have yet to issue an official editorial recommendation, it’s clear that Clinton will have an overwhelming lead in newspaper endorsements heading into Election Day.

What’s particularly unique to this presidential cycle is the number of newspapers (19) that switched from endorsing the Republican nominee in 2012 to picking Hillary Clinton. And while some of those papers have made the argument that Trump is not a reliable conservative, that doesn’t mean they have to go all the way in endorsing the liberal candidate. As The Washington Times pointed out “Clinton’s lifetime ACU rating of 8.13 is only two points higher than both Mr. Sanders’ 6.2 percent lifetime rating and Ms. Warren’s 6 percent rating. All three of the presidential hopefuls are lower on the ACU’s scale than Mr. Obama, who has a lifetime rating of 10 percent.”

Yet some of the papers that switched from Romney to Clinton have attempted to justify their selection by claiming Clinton is “bipartisan,” “pragmatic,” and a “centrist.”

The following descriptions of Hillary are from newspapers that switched from Romney in 2012 to Hillary Clinton in 2016:     

“In Clinton’s eight years in the U.S. Senate, she displayed reach and influence in foreign affairs. Though conservatives like to paint her as nakedly partisan, on Capitol Hill she gained respect from Republicans for working across the aisle: Two-thirds of her bills had GOP co-sponsors and included common ground with some of Congress’ most conservative lawmakers.”
— September 7 Dallas Morning News editorial “We recommend Hillary Clinton for president.”

“As senator of New York, she earned respect in Congress by working across the aisle and crafting bills with conservative lawmakers....Clinton has been criticized as being hawkish but has shown a measured approach to the world’s problems.”
—  September 23 Cincinnati Enquirer editorial “Enquirer: It has to be Hillary Clinton”

“Hillary Clinton has long been a centrist. Despite her tack left to woo Bernie Sanders supporters, Clinton retains her centrist roots. Her justices might not be in the mold of Antonin Scalia, but they will be accomplished individuals with the experience, education and intelligence to handle the job. They will be competent. Just as she is competent.”
— September 27 Arizona Republic editorial “The Arizona Republic editorial board endorses Hillary Clinton for president.”    

“This is what you’re going to get with Hillary – tough negotiations that yield pragmatic results.”
— Florida Sun Sentinel September 30 editorial “Sun Sentinel Editorial Board endorses Hillary Clinton for president”

“As a U.S. senator, the Democrat showed she can collaborate with Republicans, using what Roll Call labeled an ‘incremental approach” that ‘could help restore a working’ relationship between the White House and Capitol Hill that has been in tatters” for years....This paper has not endorsed a Democrat for president in its 148-year history. But we endorse Clinton. She’s the safe choice for the U.S. and for the world, for Democrats and Republicans alike.”
— San Diego Union Tribune September 30 editorial “Why Hillary Clinton is the safe choice for president”

“Conservatives fear Clinton will tip the court to the left. Unfortunately, the Senate is obstructing a centrist jurist appointed by Obama, Merrick Garland. The great irony of this election is Clinton is a centrist, pulled left by Bernie Sanders, and Trump is anything but a reliable conservative. We need a president who can deliver a clear message at home and abroad.”
— Desert Sun September 30 editorial “Hillary Clinton the right choice in historic election.”

“The art of compromise, which once was respected by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and which allowed for progress rather than gridlock, is one that Clinton understands and practices. She demonstrated that not only in the Senate, but as the nation’s chief diplomat.”
— The Columbus Dispatch October 9 editorial “For president | Trump unfit, Clinton is qualified.” 

“Like her husband, President Bill Clinton, she has built a political career out of triangulating to the center. She’s less liberal than President Barack Obama and less conservative than President George W. Bush — and after 16 years of volatility, she is likely to maintain the slow growth of the status quo.”
— Birmingham News, October 9 editorial “Endorsement: We’re with Hillary Clinton. Frankly, Donald Trump’s dangerous.” (Identical editorial in sister publications Press-Register (Mobile) and Huntsville Times. 

“Clinton would surely lead a vigorous, activist presidency, including a bipartisan drive to ‘pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.’ At the same time and crucially, she is more muscular on the international stage than much of the party would like. It took steel for Clinton to unequivocally advise Obama to greenlight the high-risk mission that killed Osama Bin Laden while Trump offers the brass of pretending that his every wish will be the world’s command.”
— New York Daily News July 28 editorial ”Daily News Editorial Board says Vote Hillary Clinton: She’s the best choice for President, while Donald Trump represents a clear and present danger to the republic.”

“Her Senate tenure earns her praise from both Democrats and Republicans.”
— Charleston Gazette-Mail (West Virginia) October 14 editorial “Gazette endorsement: Hillary Clinton for president”
