Jerry Brown and the California Wilfires

Brown vetoed the bill. Incidentally, his sister sits on the board of energy services holding company Sempra; the bill would have cost power companies money.
The author of the measure — passed unanimously by both houses of the Legislature — now says the governor missed out on a chance to tackle one of his state’s longstanding vulnerabilities: massive wildfires endangering residential communities.
We don’t know that power lines were responsible for the many lives lost (at least 31 and counting) and thousands of homes destroyed. Too bad Governor Moonbeam didn’t sign this bill, instead of the one authorizing prison time for people who refuse to refer to the sexually deranged by biologically inaccurate pronouns, or the one that made it no longer a felony to deliberately spread HIV. But in this country people get the government they ask for, and Californians asked for Jerry Brown. By now, everyone knows exactly what kind of kooky irresponsibility that entails.

Having evaded prison after committing two murders (although he owes over $33 million in a wrongful death suit) thanks to his fame and privileged pigmentation, and now having been paroled from a 33-year sentence for armed robbery, former NFL and Hollywood star O.J. Simpson will now devote himself to a clean and wholesome life. Just kidding. Whatever they pay their prostitutes, it could never be enough — especially considering how the original Nicole Brown ended up.
Maybe we should look to someplace other than the NFL and Hollywood for our role models.
