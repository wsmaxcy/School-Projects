This Gay Couple Left Iran For A Better Life. Now They Wonder If It Can Last In America.

2017-11-12

Former refugees Ramin Haghjoo and Nima Nia reflect on love and fear in the Age of Trump.

WASHINGTON ― In the best-case scenario if Ramin Haghjoo and Nima Nia still lived in Iran, they would be married. Just not to each other ― to women, probably through arranged marriages. Perhaps they could have found women also attracted to their own gender and looking to hide the fact, like one of Haghjoo’s friends did. In a bleaker scenario, they would be dead or behind bars for the crime of being what they are: gay.

Instead, Haghjoo and Nia ended up in the United States, where they married each other in a joyful ceremony this August.

The couple came to the U.S. as refugees several years ago, after fleeing Iran for Turkey. Things are better here in many ways, and they see their story as a hopeful one for other LGBTQ Iranians. They’re alive, they’re married, and they live openly as gay men.

But Haghjoo and Nia also find themselves in a country where the president tried to ban new refugees and immigrants from Iran and several other Muslim nations, on the argument that such people pose a threat to America’s safety. And they worry now about what will happen ― is already happening ― to LGBTQ people in a country under Republican rule.

They want Iran to change so that people like them can be accepted as gay couples. They want the U.S. to change so they can be accepted as gay refugees from Iran.

“After so many borders crossed, what will my next country be after tonight?” Haghjoo posted on Instagram the day of the 2016 election.

Ramin Haghjoo’s Story

Haghjoo, 31, grew up in a relatively supportive family in Tehran, but he still struggled. He came out at age 19 to a nurse, who urged him to tell his family. They accepted him, for the most part ― other than a brother who used abusive language against him until their mother threatened to take away the brother’s inheritance.

Haghjoo was exempted from the military service mandated for all Iranian men because of his sexual orientation, which the Iranian military considers a mental problem. He was terrified to tell the government about his sexuality, as Iran is a dangerous place for LGBTQ people. Homosexuality is against the law, and sex between two men can be punishable by death. Other acts, such as kissing or even just confessing to homosexuality, can lead to punishment. While there are secret networks for LGBTQ people, many of them online, members live under the constant threat of being exposed.

But Haghjoo also wanted to be honest about who he was and to avoid military service, because it can be dangerous even for closeted gay men.

He was at risk for other reasons as well. At a June 2009 protest during the Iranian Green Movement ― which called for the ouster of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ― he yelled out to warn an old woman to be careful because an armed man in a military uniform had his gun aimed at her. The man turned his gun on Haghjoo instead and shot him. The bullet ripped through the right side of his abdomen. He had surgery to remove nearly a foot of intestines and was in the hospital for almost a week.

Haghjoo spoke about the experience of being shot to a documentary crew and later found out the filmmakers planned to focus on his story. He was afraid of the attention that would draw, so he decided to flee to Turkey. The documentary aired one week after he left Iran. Afterward he wanted to return home, but his mother feared it wasn’t safe. “Do not come back,” she told him.

Nima Nia’s Story

Nia, 29, began receiving text messages from an unknown phone number back in 2006. The first said “Happy Valentine’s Day,” and the number was from Mianeh, Iran, where he was about to move for school. He replied to the texts at first, thinking they were from someone in a LGBTQ chatroom, but eventually he stopped. When he arrived in Mianeh, he received another: “Welcome to our city.” He didn’t reply.

Soon came another message threatening to call him on his home number. Then his home phone rang.

The man on the other end of the line said that he knew Nia was gay and that nothing bad would happen to him if he cooperated by going to the man’s house and named other gay people. Nia repeatedly declined to confirm that he was gay or to identify anyone else, but the man kept calling.

At his college, a security guard told Nia that a man had been there and asked for his schedule. Nia thought he saw someone following him on the street.

One day, the man called to say he was near Nia’s house. Nia could hear a siren both through the phone and through his door. He was frightened.

After months of harassment, Nia met another man who worked as a security guard at a bank and told him what was happening. The security guard contacted the man who had been threatening Nia, and the phone calls finally stopped.

But when Nia and the security guard began dating, he faced new problems. The security guard became hostile, threatening both Nia and his parents. Nia escaped that situation when he left for mandatory military service in Abadeh, Iran. (He chose not to tell authorities about his sexual orientation.)

When he returned to Mianeh two months later ― his period of military service was shortened based on his father’s past work in a war zone ― Nia got a new apartment and a new phone number. He went back to college to study art. But he still didn’t feel safe ― every call from a wrong number made him uneasy, and he kept worrying that someone might throw something through his apartment window.

Nia finally decided he couldn’t stay in Iran, even though he was only a semester away from finishing his degree. He fled to Turkey, leaving his life and art behind.

Life As Refugees

Haghjoo arrived in Turkey first, in 2010. He and Nia had been friends back in Iran, but they only began dating after Nia left their homeland as well.

For eight months, Haghjoo waited to find out whether he would be allowed to enter the United States as a refugee based on the persecution he faced for his sexual orientation, political beliefs and religion. He is a Sufi, and people like him who practice a more mystical brand of Islam have been targeted by the Iranian government. Nia, meanwhile, applied for refugee status in the U.S. based on the persecution he experienced as a gay man.

Sometimes others who had fled their homes and were now stuck in Turkey argued that being gay made it easier for Nia and Haghjoo ― that they could move through the refugee process more quickly, while it took longer for political refugees. They didn’t understand that being gay in Iran had been “a prison,” Nia said.

Being in Turkey was difficult, too. They had hardly any money and at times went days with no food while waiting for money transfers to come through. Nia was abruptly kicked out of a house he’d rented in the middle of winter because the owner sold it.

At least they were together. When Haghjoo first told Nia he loved him, Nia wasn’t ready to say it back. Not until 2011, when Haghjoo learned his application for refugee status had been accepted and he prepared to leave for the U.S., did Nia finally say he loved him, too. Another year passed before Nia’s refugee admission was approved. He joined his partner in Philadelphia in November 2012.

It was hard coming to the United States, even if they believed it was their best option. Their right to be citizens of their native country had been wrenched away from them. They feared that a family member would get sick and die, and they wouldn’t be able to go back and say goodbye. “I left all of these big and beautiful things for freedom,” Nia said. “It’s not fair.”

Life In America

Adjusting to the U.S. wasn’t simple. In Philadelphia, Nia worked a few jobs that he hated, including in a Walmart stockroom. He wasn’t able to use the skills he learned in art school ― he had to take the options available to a newcomer to the U.S. He began to lose hope in this American life.

In 2014, the couple moved to Washington, D.C., to look for full-time work, and Nia finally got to do something creative: designing artwork and producing a podcast for a nonprofit. But he quit that job, he said, because the organization didn’t treat him well. Now he’s working on a comic book narrated by a cat. Haghjoo is employed as a human rights researcher at a different nonprofit.

The couple has made many friends here. They were featured on the popular Humans of New York Facebook page ― in a photo of them standing on a pathway framed with snow and a short caption: “We’re gay refugees from Iran.” More than 240,000 people liked it.

The 2016 election was difficult for them to watch. They both think anti-LGBTQ sentiment has become more explicit under President Donald Trump. The president attempted to bar transgender people from the military, and his Justice Department has said the 1964 Civil Rights Act doesn’t prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. Haghjoo said he has a “very real” fear that if he went to a largely pro-Trump part of the country, he would be in danger. He avoids traveling to those places.

Trump’s efforts to stop Iranians and others from majority-Muslim nations from immigrating to the U.S. have hit them hard, too. It doesn’t make sense to punish people who don’t support their country’s government for what that government does, Haghjoo said. Barring refugees in particular seems cruel to him. Americans should put themselves in refugees’ shoes and think about what those individuals have been through, he said.

“I’m not afraid of Donald Trump, but I’m afraid of the ideology he’s representing,” Nia said. “That ideology is not kind, it’s not pro-human rights, it’s not pro-diversity.”

Haghjoo said he’s “fed up with fighting for rights,” and if it comes to a point in the U.S. when gay people begin to lose their freedom like they did in Iran, he would leave.

“I’ll find somewhere that I’m accepted and I’m free and I’ll go there,” said Haghjoo. “Which might not be a place on Earth, so we have to fight.”

“Unless we move to another planet,” Nia said.

A Time For Celebration

But it’s not all bad. Last January, Nia proposed to Haghjoo in Boston. It was a surprise ― Haghjoo thought their friends were gathering from around the country for his birthday. Nia played a video with pictures of the two of them, set to Leonard Cohen’s “Dance Me to the End of Love.” Then, he presented Haghjoo with a cake decorated with their photo and the words “Marry me.” Everyone cried.

They consider themselves opposites in some ways. It would be boring to be with someone just like himself, Nia said. He loves that his husband is kind to everyone and feels responsibility for those around him. “I fell in love with all of that, unfortunately,” Nia joked. Haghjoo loves that Nia is honest and dedicated to art and creativity.

The two married on Aug. 26 at Mount Airy Mansion in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, a short drive from Washington. The only family member there was one of Nia’s sisters, who also lives in the U.S. Most of their relatives don’t support the marriage, even though Haghjoo’s family is generally open-minded about his sexuality. But even if those living in Iran had wanted to come to the wedding, it would have been next to impossible to obtain the necessary visas. It would have been hard for them to get U.S. visas even before Trump’s executive orders barring entry for Iranians. (Both orders have now been blocked in court.)

But Haghjoo and Nia still celebrated. Their first dance was to a song with lyrics by Seyed Medhi Mousavi, an Iranian political refugee who now lives in Norway. He wrote it for them specifically.

“Imagine there is one for you, who wants to leave the crying behind,” the lyrics say, as translated from Farsi. “He’s that person you saw in your dreams, the one who can understand the depth of your pain. The one who is different from the rest of the world, the one who knows life is hard, who has his own troubles, but still, sitting next to you, he is happy!”

They want to share their story so that other gay people now living in fear around the world know it’s possible to find a life out of the closet ― although you may have to leave everything you know behind to do it. “I left money, I left my car, I left home, I left my friends,” said Haghjoo. “We lost many things.”

“Now you want to make a new life, and an amazing one, with your love,” he continued. “Sometimes I say, Nima, he’s my money, he’s my parents, he’s my brother, he’s my old friends and my family. He’s my everything.”

She Has Lived Legally In The U.S. For 19 Years. Now The Trump Administration Wants Her Out.

2017-11-07

Maria Elena Hernandez is one of about 5,300 Nicaraguan immigrants set to lose temporary protected status in 2019.

Maria Elena Hernandez, a 58-year-old immigrant from Nicaragua, has lived legally in the United States for 19 years. She has family here that she sees daily and a job as a janitor. She is active in her union and volunteers.

Hernandez was at work Monday evening when she received a call from a union organizer who warned that her whole life could soon fall apart. The Trump administration announced that it is ending the temporary protected status that has allowed Hernandez and about 5,300 other Nicaraguan immigrants to remain in the country since 1999. They now have until January 2019 to either find a legal avenue to stay in the country or get out.

Hernandez felt betrayed.

“I was expecting more empathy, more comprehension of all of the good that we contribute to the economy and to the culture here in this country,” Hernandez said, speaking through an interpreter.

There are about 300,000 immigrants living in the U.S. under temporary protected status (TPS), and it will be up to the current administration to determine whether they should be able to stay legally or become targets of President Donald Trump’s deportation efforts. It’s often politically difficult to end protections for people who have lived in the U.S. for years, but Trump did it for Sudanese immigrants with TPS and then again in a separate program for young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. His administration is now weighing whether to do the same for Haitians and Salvadorans, and will soon have to reconsider the fate of Hondurans, whom he granted a six-month extension on Monday.

Trump and his officials called on Congress to step in to help those immigrants. But they also put them at risk of being cast out of a country where they’ve lived for years.

Hernandez doesn’t plan to stay in the U.S. without legal status, but she doesn’t want to go back to Nicaragua. She came to the U.S. in December 1998 on a tourist visa to visit her brothers and stayed because of instability at home. Nicaragua was designated for TPS in January 1999, after Hurricane Mitch devastated the country the previous year.

Hernandez applied for TPS and has renewed it multiple times in the years since. She put down roots, like most other TPS recipients have. She lives with family, including two of her brothers, in an apartment in Plantation, Florida. The family is “always together,” she said, going to church or the beach, or having Sunday dinners.

Leaving them would be particularly painful after their third brother died of cancer last November, Hernandez said. She called her brothers her “reason to live.”

“I already lost one brother, and the idea of being separated from them makes me feel so sad,” she said, adding later, “Just with the death of my brother we all feel a great loss as if there’s a part of our body that’s missing.”

Hernandez and her late brother used to work together at a local college, where she is still a janitor. She was active in helping them fight for raises and better benefits as a member of the 32BJ SEIU, a local of the Service Employees International Union.

When she found out about the TPS decision on Monday evening, one of her U.S. citizen co-workers said they would all fight together to help her stay.

The first step will be to visit a lawyer to determine whether she has legal options. Although she has family members who are U.S. citizens, the sponsorship process is slow and there might not be enough time.

Her best bet is for Congress to pass a bill granting her and other TPS recipients permanent legal status. The Trump administration and other TPS critics have argued the program is not meant to provide long-term status and that it should be ended if the country is no longer suffering from the situation that led to the protected status.

Hernandez said the situation is “not fine” in Nicaragua or in Honduras, which received a six-month extension by default because the administration failed to come to a decision about whether to extend it.

The United States “is supposed to be a leader in human rights and a country that critiques other countries for failing to respect human rights like the countries that we come from,” she said.

“How is it possible that they could then turn around and send us back to these countries?”

Trump Administration To End Protections For Nicaraguan Immigrants, Extend For Hondurans

2017-11-06

The Department of Homeland Security’s acting secretary could not come to a decision about what to do with Honduran recipients, officials said.

WASHINGTON ― The Trump administration is giving notice to about 5,300 Nicaraguan immigrants who have lived in the U.S. on temporary protected status for years: They now have until January 2019 to leave the country, find legal approval to stay or become undocumented.

But the fate of Honduran immigrants with temporary protected status, which allows them to legally remain in the U.S. and work, remains uncertain. Although the Department of Homeland Security had until Monday to determine whether to extend the protections for both countries, Acting Secretary Elaine Duke made no decision on temporary protected status (TPS) for Hondurans because she wanted to review more information, officials said Monday.

The non-decision automatically triggered a six-month extension for the approximately 86,000 Hondurans with TPS, with the possibility of further extensions. 

Immigrants and their advocates have been concerned for months that President Donald Trump’s efforts to drive out undocumented people and keep out other foreign nationals would lead to similarly harsh action on TPS. The program allows some 300,000 immigrants to remain in the U.S. ― where many of them have lived for two decades or more and have U.S.-born children ― after a catastrophic event in their native country. DHS officials must decide in the coming months whether to extend the protections for Salvadorans, who make up the bulk of TPS recipients, and Haitians.

The situation is shaky for TPS holders. Last week, the State Department advised the Department of Homeland Security that countries in Central America and Haiti were no longer suffering from the problems that led past administrations to designate them for TPS.

The Trump administration has proved it’s willing to end protections for immigrants. DHS already ended TPS for immigrants from Sudan, with a 12-month sunset period; and previously warned Haitians they would likely not see another extension. The department also rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a separate program that granted protections and work authorization to young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. DACA and TPS combined are protecting more than a million people from being deported and allowing them to remain in the legal workforce and in school.

Just as Trump said Congress should act when he rescinded DACA, an administration official said Monday that lawmakers should intervene if they want to prevent TPS holders from being kicked out of the country.

The official, who declined to be quoted by name, said “Congress may wish to find a solution that allows [TPS holders] a more permanent status versus this 18-month to 18-month temporary fix that has been going on for two decades,” referring to the repeated short-term extensions. “That is up to Congress, but the administration would support Congress’s efforts to find such a solution.”

The program was designed, as its name indicates, to be temporary, and the homeland security secretary can extend it in increments of six, 12 or 18 months. Administration officials said Monday that they are required by statute to consider the conditions that led to the TPS designation, such as damage sustained by a hurricane.

Honduras and Nicaragua were both designated for TPS in 1999 after a hurricane caused extensive damage to Central American countries. Immigrants are eligible for TPS only if they have lived in the U.S. since before their native country was first designated for the program, so all of those recipients have lived in the U.S. 18 years or more.

DHS determined that Nicaragua would not require an extension for TPS because conditions there had improved, an official told reporters. The nation’s government did not request an extension, the official said.

The officials declined to say whether the White House had any involvement in the decision but said it was made by the acting secretary based on assessment of facts and the statute.  

TPS for Nicaraguans was set to expire Jan. 5 but will now end a year later to give recipients time to make arrangements. They are required to either find legal status to stay in the U.S. or leave by that time. Administration officials said there are no plans to target former TPS holders for deportation, although they would not be protected from it. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers TPS, does not proactively give information about the status to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which leads deportation efforts, an official said.

They are our neighbors, our co-workers, and parents to U.S. citizen children. Deporting them will needlessly tear thousands of families apart.
Amanda Baran, Immigrant Legal Resource Center
Immigrant rights advocates condemned the decision. Amanda Baran of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center called it “morally reprehensible.”

“For almost two decades, TPS holders from Nicaragua have lived alongside us and contributed to our economy and our communities,” she said in a statement. “They are our neighbors, our co-workers, and parents to U.S. citizen children. Deporting them will needlessly tear thousands of families apart, with no plan in place to help them after breaking our decades-long commitment to protect them from deportation.”  

Later this month, the administration will be required to announce whether it will extend TPS for Haitian TPS recipients who have lived in the U.S. since at least January 2011. (The country was designated for TPS following an earthquake there in 2010.) In May, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly, who is now White House chief of staff, warned Haitians that he was likely to end their protections when he approved a short-term extension of TPS for the country. Officials said in May that Haitian TPS holders should use that time to get their affairs in order for leaving the U.S.

If Trump and his administration want a permanent solution for TPS recipients, there are efforts underway in Congress. A group of Democrats in Congress is pushing for a bill that would allow TPS recipients who have lived in the U.S. with the protections for at least three years to pursue permanent legal status.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the decision “is a cowardly assault on thousands of families.” She said House Democrats were calling on the administration “to immediately rescind this decision” but that if it does not, Congress should pass a permanent fix.

“With this act of senseless prejudice, the Administration is once again putting bigotry over our nation’s values and security,” Pelosi said in a statement. “This is a dark night of heartbreak and tears for thousands of families targeted by this decision and all the others fearful of losing their Temporary Protected Status because of President Trump.”

Trump’s Justice Department Wants ACLU Lawyers Disciplined In Jane Doe Undocumented Teen Abortion Case

2017-11-03

The government claims the ACLU hurried the abortion to head off an appeal. The ACLU says government lawyers failed to act “quickly enough.”

WASHINGTON ― The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to take up a case involving an undocumented teen who received an abortion, urging the high court to toss an appeals court ruling that allowed the procedure and to consider disciplining American Civil Liberties Union lawyers who represented the girl.

The Justice Department’s lengthy filing indicates the administration planned to seek Supreme Court intervention before the teen, known the court case by the pseudonym Jane Doe, received her Oct. 25 abortion after month of delay by U.S. authorities. The filing alleges the girl’s ACLU lawyers misled the government about the timing of the abortion.

“After informing Justice Department attorneys that the procedure would occur on October 26th, Jane Doe’s attorneys scheduled the abortion for the early morning hours of October 25th, thereby thwarting Supreme Court review,” DOJ spokesman Devin O’Malley said in a statement. “In light of that, the Justice Department believes the judgment under review should be vacated, and discipline may be warranted against Jane Doe’s attorneys.”

The ACLU said called the allegation “baseless.” The group’s legal director, David Cole, said the lawyers were working in the best interests of their client. 

“That government lawyers failed to seek judicial review quickly enough is their fault, not ours,” Cole said in a statement. “We won’t let this distract us from the real issue here, which is that there are many more young women like Jane Doe out there who are still unable to get the care they need because of the Trump administration’s unconstitutional policies. We will not stop fighting until we have justice for every young woman like Jane.”

The 17-year-old Jane Doe had an abortion last week after a ruling by a federal appeals court. But that didn’t end the legal battle. The federal government argued that it was within its rights to block unaccompanied minors in its custody from leaving shelters for abortions, a problem that goes far beyond fighting in court to extend one teen’s unwanted pregnancy. The lawsuit could have major abortion-rights implications for for both undocumented immigrant minors and other pregnant women in government custody.

In the Jane Doe case, a Department of Justice attorney argued that the government was not blocking the teen from getting an abortion because she was free to return to her home country or could be released to a sponsor in the U.S. ― two infeasible options, according to her attorney. Abortion is illegal in Jane Doe’s native country, and leaving the U.S. would prevent her from making a legal case to stay in the U.S. The government had not found her a sponsor to take her in.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which has custody of Jane Doe, for a month blocked her from going to an abortion clinic after she received permission from a Texas judge to make her own decision about terminating her pregnancy, and sent her to a “crisis pregnancy center” to discourage her.

The government’s attorney said the Office of Refugee Resettlement could not be required to “facilitate” Jane Doe’s abortion, which she defined as granting permission for the procedure and care afterward. Jane Doe all along had planned to pay for her own abortion and arranged transportation to and from appointments.

The government’s argument also could be applied to any other pregnant unaccompanied minor in Office of Refugee Resettlement custody, and there’s every indication they would be treated the same was as Jane Doe. The agency is led by director Scott Lloyd, a former attorney for the Knights of Columbus and ardent opponent of abortion.

Under Lloyd’s leadership, the office instituted a policy that requires him or a designee to sign off on any abortions for immigrant minors in the agency’s custody. This is a switch from previous policy, in which directors were involved in abortion decisions only to approve that government funds be used in cases of rape, incest and threats to the life of the mother.

Lloyd reportedly said he would allow pregnant immigrant minors to leave Office of Refugee Resettlement shelters only for “pregnancy services and life-affirming options counseling.” He and other officials have personally spoken to pregnant teens in custody to discourage them from abortions, according to the ACLU. Lloyd refused to give a yes or no answer to a congresswoman who asked last week whether he had done so.

The Trump administration argued in court filings that it has “strong and constitutionally legitimate interests in promoting childbirth, in refusing to facilitate abortion, and in not providing incentives for pregnant minors to illegally cross the border to obtain elective abortions while in federal custody.”

Although the lawsuit and administration policy has thus far only applied to immigrant minors in Office of Refugee Resettlement custody, the arguments about facilitation also could affect other women detained by the federal government, such as those in prison or in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention. The Department of Justice attorney acknowledged that those women are now allowed to obtain abortions and are cared for after doing so ― the same two things she said were “facilitation” for the Office of Refugee Resettlement ― but she did not argue against those policies.

DOJ’s filing on Friday said the government had “asked to be kept informed of the timing of Ms. Doe’s abortion procedure, and one of respondent’s counsel agreed to do so.” The government told the Supreme Court clerk’s office and the ACLU attorneys that it planned to file an application seeking a stay the next morning. Because of that notice, the government alleges, the ACLU moved to expedite Jane Doe’s abortion.

“Although Ms. Doe’s representatives informed the  government of the change in timing, they did not inform the government of the other two developments—which kept the government in the dark about when Ms. Doe was scheduled to have an abortion,” the government filing says. “The government recognizes that respondent’s counsel have a duty to zealously advocate on behalf of their client, but they also have duties to this Court and to the Bar. It appears under the circumstances that those duties may have been violated, and that disciplinary action may therefore be warranted. At the least, this Court may wish to seek an explanation from counsel regarding this highly unusual chain of events.”

Senate Republicans Say Trump Ruled Out ‘Dreamer’ Protections In Spending Bill

2017-11-02

WASHINGTON ― Senate Republicans said Thursday that President Donald Trump has ruled out what some consider the best hope for undocumented young people who could face deportation because of him: attaching protections for the the so-called Dreamers to an omnibus government spending bill.

The hard line, if Trump and his party stick to it, will likely lead to a government shutdown fight. Some Democrats have said they won’t support a spending bill in December, when current government funding expires, without protections for Dreamers, setting the stage for the possible shutdown.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Republicans likely won’t address the status of Dreamers ― undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children ― until January or February. He was among the Senate Republicans who met with the president earlier Thursday.

The Dreamer issue “is not going to be part of the year-end omnibus ... and it’s not going to be done on a standalone basis,” Cornyn told reporters at the Capitol. “I think everybody understands that, but they just want to deny the reality. But that’s what’s going to happen.”

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who also attended the meeting with Trump, said, “We definitely ruled out putting any kind” of protections for Dreamers in an omnibus spending bill. “Period. End of story.”

Instead, dealing with the Dreamers must be part of larger legislation that addresses other immigration issues, he said.

Nearly 700,000 young immigrants are at risk of losing deportation protections and work authorization because of Trump’s decision in October to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The program allows young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to stay and work legally on a temporary basis.

The party line from the president and Republicans has been that Congress had six months from Trump’s announcement on ending DACA to come up with a plan to prevent large-scale deportations. After the six-month period, larger numbers of DACA recipients who the president barred from renewing their status will begin to lose it. In reality, though, DACA recipients are already being affected by the decision.

Trump’s decision to end the program prevented anyone without protections from receiving them. It also will lead to some current recipients losing their status before March 6. As many as 22,000 people who were eligible under the president’s plan to renew their status under DACA did not do so, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which administers the program.

They will become at risk of deportation before March 6, which is why immigrant rights advocates have said Congress must act as soon as possible, rather than waiting until early next year.

Some immigrant rights advocates believe that attaching Dreamer protections to a spending bill is the best ― or only ― way to get them through Congress. Some conservative House members said last week that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told them he believed DACA provisions would be in the spending deal, although he later denied it.

Democrats have signaled openness to going along with some border security measures as part of approving DACA protections ― but not the long wish list sent by Trump to make sweeping changes to the immigration system, largely with the goals of driving out undocumented people and cutting legal paths to the country.

If you keep trying to add more and more into the bill, I think it likely collapses under its own weight.
Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.)

Cotton, who has with Trump’s backing pushed for a bill that would cut legal immigration in half, said that there was agreement at Thursday’s meeting with Trump that a DACA package must end so-called “chain migration,” which allows people to sponsor for visas family members besides spouses and unmarried minor children.

“The logical, coherent, tightly wound package of giving legal status to the DACA recipients is trying to control” chain migration, as well as measures for greater enforcement of immigration laws, he said. Such measures include enhanced border security, hiring more immigration judges and mandating employment verification of immigration status.

But at the same  time, Cotton said such a legislative package should not be “comprehensive.”

“If you keep trying to add more and more into the bill, I think it likely collapses under its own weight,” he said.

Cornyn said Trump asked that any DACA package it address chain migration and the diversity visa lottery.

Trump has called on Congress to eliminate the latter program following the terrorist attack in New York City on Tuesday allegedly perpetrated by a Uzbek immigrant who came to the U.S. in 2010 on a diversity visa. Those visas are granted each year to about 50,000 people from countries with lower immigration levels, about half of them in Africa.

Diversity visa lottery winners undergo security screening before being approved, although the White House falsely said they do not. Authorities have said the New York terror suspect was likely radicalized once in the U.S.

Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who was also in the meeting with Trump but declined to comment on its specifics, said he favors ending the diversity visa lottery, although not necessarily as part of a DACA package. He is a sponsor of a bill that would grant legal status to certain Dreamers, and said it was important that a DACA package not get too bloated.

“There are a lot of issues on immigration,” Lankford said. “The challenge has been it gets so big, at some point it gets so weighty, that everyone has enough reasons to vote against it as well as for it and it dies.”

Trump Blamed The Visa Lottery For A Terrorist Attack. But Ending It Wouldn’t End Terrorism.

2017-11-01

Experts say the focus shouldn’t be on shutting down the visa lottery but on preventing radicalization.

President Donald Trump and his White House are using the Tuesday terrorist attack in New York City to push their goal of cutting legal immigration by misleading the public about the diversity visa lottery system. But immigration experts argue that early available evidence indicates the focus should be on preventing radicalization ― and that eliminating the diversity lottery or blocking people from certain nations won’t prevent such attacks.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders falsely said on Wednesday that there is no vetting for the diversity visa lottery, a program that allows 50,000 people to move to the country each year from countries with low immigration rates.  

“You can’t randomly select people, not have them thoroughly vetted and not have the ability to know whether these people want to do bad things or good things when they get here,” Sanders said at a press briefing. “I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask that people that want to come to this country go through a vetting process to make sure that when they get here they want to contribute to society and not harm the people of this country.”

Trump said something similar earlier in the day when calling for an end to the program.

“We don’t want lotteries where the wrong people are in the lotteries,” he said.

Both Trump and Sanders suggested that people who entered the U.S. through the diversity visa lottery might be more dangerous than those who entered through “merit-based system,” which is one based on an applicants’ employer, family, education or other factors. The diversity visa lottery was created in 1990 to give an opportunity for people from countries with low immigration levels to come to the U.S. even if they did not have family or employer ties here. 

Diversity visa lottery applicants do go through vetting, just like anyone else granted a green card to enter the United States. But like any other immigrant ― and native-born U.S. citizens ― it can be difficult to predict whether they will be radicalized once they arrive. Officials said that Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, the suspected attacker in Tuesday’s attack, was radicalized once he was already in the U.S., meaning that any stricter vetting on the lottery program likely wouldn’t have prevented his entry, which took place seven years ago.

“There’s no evidence at all that people who might meet a merit-based requirement would somehow be less likely to radicalize than anybody else,” Theresa Brown, director of immigration policy at Bipartisan Policy Center, told HuffPost. “We just don’t know that, we don’t have evidence of that, and that’s not really what that’s about anyway. [The administration is] slamming apples and oranges together into a mush right now.”

David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute who has analyzed terrorism rates among immigrants, said he hadn’t “seen any evidence that immigration vetting was implicated,” although he, like other experts quoted for this article, noted that he only knows what has been reported publicly.

“The focus on vetting and thinking that people are trying to get here to commit acts of terrorism is not a legitimate lens to view the bulk of this problem,” Bier said.

A Department of Homeland Security intelligence assessment from March confirmed that most foreign-born violent extremists do not come to the U.S. radicalized, but become radicalized once they’ve been living here for several years.

“Most of the individuals who radicalize tend to be quite well integrated,” Lorenzo Vidino, director of George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, told Politico Magazine last year. He pointed to the examples of attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., Orlando, Florida and Chattanooga, Tenn., which were perpetrated by people whose radicalization was a gradual process that was in no way linked to how they immigrated to the U.S.

DHS does run a Countering Violent Extremism program which works with communities “to build and sustain local prevention efforts and promote the use of counter-narratives to confront violent extremist messaging online.”

The agency said in the assessment that it’s seen success with its mentoring and integration services as part of the program, but these are focused on school-aged immigrants and are specific to refugees and asylees. Someone like Saipov, who came to the U.S. at the age of 22 and not as a refugee or asylee, would have been unlikely to be targeted by such services.

It would be more helpful for Trump to focus on policies that can prevent and detect radicalization now, based on current public information about the New York City attacker, said Adam Blickstein, a former Pentagon official in the Obama administration.

“The law enforcement community and the intelligence community is probably full bore into what radicalized him, what inspired him, whether he got any operational help in the U.S. or abroad,” Blickstein said. “Meanwhile, the commander-in-chief is perpetuating this notion that if he was prevented from coming to the U.S. in 2010 that would have solved everything.”

Trump typically touts his travel ban following terror attacks around the world, using it as an example of why the U.S. needs a better immigration system. Sanders said Wednesday that the administration wouldn’t rule out adding Uzbekistan to the list of targeted countries in the ban (which was temporarily struck down in federal court last month).

If the Trump administration did add Uzbekistan to the list, it would be a reminder of how travel ban lists are often arbitrary, Bier said. The latest travel ban is based on the countries’ ability to screen their citizens and share information with the U.S., and by not placing Uzbekistan on the list, the government has indicated that the country’s security efforts are up to par.

“If Uzbekistan was to be added to this list, it would be even more readily apparent that that really is what’s happening here ― that the president is the one driving the outcome and not an objective set of criteria developed by experts in immigration vetting,” Bier said.

Trump Blames NYC Attack On Diversity Visa Lottery Program

2017-11-01

“We must get MUCH tougher,” the president tweeted Wednesday.

President Donald Trump said Wednesday, one day after a deadly attack struck New York City, that he would push to eliminate the diversity visa lottery program “as soon as possible.” 

The suspect in Tuesday’s attack, 29-year-old Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, used the visa lottery program to legally emigrate from Uzbekistan in 2010, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed.  

“I’m going to ask Congress to immediately initiate work to get rid of this program,” Trump said in remarks at the White House. ”‘Diversity lottery’ sounds nice. It’s not nice. It’s not good. It’s not good. It hasn’t been good.”

The president said he would also push to end “chain migration,” a phrase that immigration restrictionists use to describe allowing immigrants to sponsor their family members to join them in the U.S. Trump said Saipov sponsored others to immigrate to the country.

“We want people that are going to help our country,” Trump said. “We want people that are going to keep our country safe. We don’t want lotteries where the wrong people are in the lotteries.” 

“And guess what? Who are the suckers that get those people?” he added, seemingly referring to the U.S.

Trump called Saipov an “animal” and said he would consider sending him to Guantanamo Bay, a detention facility where alleged perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks have remained on trial for years. 

Restrictionists have for years targeted the lottery, which provides legal pathways for people from countries with historically low immigration rates to the U.S.,  making it an ideal target for Trump. Established in 1990, the lottery provides only 50,000 visas annually, and applicants are required to have completed at least a high school education or at least two years of work experience. Visas are distributed among nationals from six different regions. 

Trump is backing a bill that would end the diversity visa lottery program and cut other forms of family-based routes to come to the country legally, with the explicit goal of halving legal immigration. 

Eliminating the lottery was also included on a lengthy list of policy demands that the president sent to Congress last month. Trump laid out the requests after eliminating a program that protects young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and saying he would sign a bill to let them stay in the country only if he was granted other policy concessions. 

Trump has called for slashing legal immigration by moving to a “merit-based” system that would allow fewer people to come to the U.S. based on family ties or through the visa lottery. He did so again on Wednesday.

Trump called the lottery program a “Chuck Schumer beauty,” piggybacking off of other right-wing attacks on the Democratic senator from New York, who was one of the people to introduce the bill. He also sponsored the larger immigration bill that ultimately passed.

Schumer shot back Wednesday, saying in a statement that Trump “should be focusing on the real solution ― anti-terrorism funding ― which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget.”

Schumer helped push for the creation of the diversity visa lottery, but he also co-authored a bill that would have ended it. In 2013, he was part of the so-called Gang of Eight who drafted a bill that would have granted a path to citizenship to many undocumented immigrants, dramatically ramped up border security efforts and overhauled legal immigration. The bill passed the Senate but never got a vote in the House.

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), another member of the Gang of Eight, came to Schumer’s defense on Wednesday by pointing out that the 2013 bill “did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms.”

“I know, I was there,” Flake tweeted. 

Trump likely tagged “Fox & Friends” in one of his tweets because Sebastian Gorka, a former assistant to the president, appeared on the show Wednesday morning to discuss the visa program and advocate for its revision.

“The idea that we’re just going to ― if you got a high school diploma and two years of work experience, we can roll the dice and can you come into America and it’s not based upon whether or not you are [a] strength [to] the nation ― that has to end,” Gorka said.

He mentioned countries like Australia and New Zealand, which he claimed have “incredibly stringent immigration requirements” based on education.

“No more political correctness,” he continued. “Political correctness can kill people.”

Advocates of lower immigration levels frequently cite Australia’s merit-based system, but the country actually accepts far more immigrants as a percentage of its population than the U.S. does. 

Although Senate Democrats agreed to eliminate the diversity visa lottery program as part of the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill, there is no consensus within the party. In 2013, the Congressional Black Caucus expressed concern about plans to do away with the visas, about half of which go to people from African nations. 

The Uzbek population in the U.S. is relatively small, and a majority of new immigrants from the country came on diversity visas. Sixty-nine percent of Uzbek immigrants in 2010 were granted visas through the lottery, and only 2 percent came as refugees, according to analysis of government data by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. 

Tuesday afternoon, in the hours after the attack, Trump tweeted that it “looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person.” He then appeared to suggest the event may be linked to the militant group that calls itself the Islamic State, which has not yet been found to have any connection to the attack. 

At least eight people were killed and 12 were injured after a man drove a Home Depot rental truck down a bike path on the West Side Highway, striking several people. The driver also rammed the truck into a school bus. Saipov, who was injured in the attack, was later taken into police custody.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the incident an “act of terror.”

ACLU Sues Over 10-Year-Old Undocumented Immigrant Seized After Emergency Surgery

2017-10-31

Border Patrol agents took Rosa Maria Hernandez into custody in Texas last week.

The ACLU sued the Trump administration on Tuesday for detaining a 10-year-old undocumented immigrant and separating her from her parents after Border Patrol agents encountered the girl at a Texas checkpoint on her way to emergency surgery.

The ACLU gave notice on Monday that it would file a lawsuit if the Office of Refugee Resettlement failed to release 10-year-old Rosa Maria Hernandez by 3 p.m. on Tuesday. Rosa Maria remained in custody after the deadline.

“There’s no reason to hold this child,” ACLU attorney Michael Tan told HuffPost. “This is probably the most outrageous case I’ve ever worked on. It’s mind-boggling.”

Rosa Maria’s case drew nationwide attention last week, when Border Patrol agents apprehended her after she underwent emergency gallbladder surgery. Rosa Maria has cerebral palsy and developmental delays, and has lived in the U.S with her family since she was 3 months old ― not exactly the type of hardened criminal undocumented immigrant the Trump administration has claimed is its primary focus.

Border Patrol agents encountered Rosa Maria Oct. 24 while she was being transported in an ambulance from a hospital in Laredo, Texas, where she lives with her family, to another hospital in Corpus Christi. Border Patrol operates as much as 100 miles from the border, so checkpoints are often unavoidable for people in border regions.

Border Patrol agents delayed the ambulance for 30 minutes, according to the ACLU. They eventually allowed Rosa Maria continue to the Corpus Christi hospital, but followed her and waited as she underwent emergency surgery. Agents apprehended Rosa Maria on Wednesday, when she was discharged from the hospital.

The Trump administration then took the girl to an Office of Refugee Resettlement shelter in San Antonio, treating her as an unaccompanied minor immigrant ― even though she has lived with her parents for her entire life, most of it in the U.S. (Rosa Maria’s adult cousin, who is a U.S. citizen, had accompanied her to the Corpus Christi hospital rather than her parents.)

Unaccompanied minors apprehended at the border go into the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement until it can find sponsors to take them in, but officials would allow neither Rosa Maria’s cousin nor her grandfather, a legal permanent resident, to take her home, according to a family attorney.

The ACLU argued in a letter Tan wrote on Monday that Rosa Maria’s detention is illegal and has no basis, in part because she should not be considered an unaccompanied minor. Her arrest and detention violates a 1997 legal settlement that requires the government to place immigrant children in “least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor’s age and special needs” and to “release a minor from [their] custody without unnecessary delay,” Tan wrote.

The government has not alleged that Rosa Maria’s family is unfit, Tan said. In the letter, he wrote that Rosa Maria, who has the cognitive development of a 6-year-old, “is completely dependent on her mother” due to her medical condition, and “needs this care, stability, routine, and support.”

“It’s a nightmare for the family,” Tan told HuffPost. “It’s horrible.”

The president’s callous immigration policies continue to reach new, inhumane lows.
Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas)
Customs and Border Protection, which includes the U.S. Border Patrol, said in a statement that agents had to take the child into custody after encountering her because she was in the U.S. without legal status and was not with her parents. 

“The law specifically defines who is a parent or legal guardian and there is no discretion with regard to the law whether or not the agents should enforce the law,” CBP said in a statement. 

CBP also defended the agents against allegations that they violated its “sensitive locations” policy, which instructs immigration and border enforcement officers to avoid medical facilities, along with schools, places of worship and protests.

“CBP has a policy regarding sensitive locations such as hospitals, but it should be stressed that the encounter took place at a checkpoint and the actions taken were in accordance with the law and carried out as humanely as possible,” the agency said in its statement. 

The Office of Refugee Resettlement declined to comment on a specific case as a matter of policy, but said in a statement that the agency has procedures to ensure safety of minors in its custody, including their health care. Its policy requires the release of minors to sponsors in a “safe and timely” manner “that promotes public safety and ensures that sponsors are able to provide for the physical and mental well-being of” the unaccompanied minor, according to the agency.

Members of Congress, religious leaders and human rights advocates have decried Rosa Maria’s detention, in part because she was stopped on her way to emergency surgery and taken into custody during her recovery. Border Patrol officers followed Rosa Maria and entered the hospital in spite of the agency’s “sensitive locations” policy.

“Any plans for Rosa Maria’s removal from the United States should be cancelled and any proceedings against her should be administratively closed based on humanitarian grounds,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said in a statement on Tuesday. ”The Trump administration needs to focus its resources on targeting dangerous criminals, not ill children. The president’s callous immigration policies continue to reach new, inhumane lows.”

Border Agents Apprehend 10-Year-Old After Emergency Surgery

2017-10-25

Enforcement officers first encountered the undocumented immigrant when she was on her way from one hospital to another.

U.S. Border Patrol officers waited as a 10-year-old girl in Texas with cerebral palsy underwent emergency surgery and then detained her, after first discovering she was an undocumented immigrant at a checkpoint on her way to the hospital, according to immigrant rights advocates and her family.  

The child, Rosa Maria Hernandez, was released from the hospital on Wednesday but can’t return home to her parents after her emergency gallbladder surgery, said Priscila Martinez of the Workers Defense Action Fund, who is in communication with the girl’s attorney and family. Instead, Rosa Maria was transferred from Corpus Christi to San Antonio and held by the government. She was still in custody as of Thursday morning, and her attorney said she could be there for weeks or even months.

Officials told Rosa Maria’s attorney that she will be processed as an unaccompanied minor in the same manner as children apprehended at the border without their parents, Martinez said. The girl has been in the U.S. since she was about 3 months old and lives with her family in Laredo, Texas. Her mother, Felipa De La Cruz, is also undocumented, according to the Corpus Christi Caller-Times.

Rosa Maria’s grandfather, who is a legal permanent resident, and a cousin who is a U.S. citizen both offered to sponsor her so she could be released, but government officials refused, attorney Leticia Gonzalez told reporters on Thursday.

The Customs and Border Protection agency confirmed that Border Patrol officers discovered Rosa Maria was undocumented when she and an adult cousin, who is a U.S. citizen, went through a checkpoint inside the U.S. while traveling from a hospital in Laredo to one in Corpus Christi.

Border agents then “escorted her and her cousin to a Corpus Christi hospital where she could receive appropriate medical care,” the agency said in a statement.

“The Laredo Sector Border Patrol is committed to enforcing the immigration laws of this nation... Per the immigration laws of the United States, once medically cleared she will be processed accordingly,” the agency said.

They’re treating her like a hardened convict who has been taken to the hospital for treatment.
Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas)

Gonzalez, Rosa Maria’s attorney, said that border agents did not simply escort her and her cousin to the hospital ― they also went inside and waited outside her room, even following her when she was taken to tests and surgery. When the girl was discharged, four border patrol agents were initially standing outside her room, which frightened her, Gonzalez said.

“It’s stunning that federal agents would be waiting outside the hospital room of a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) told reporters Thursday. “They’re treating her like a hardened convict who has been taken to the hospital for treatment.”

De La Cruz said Thursday that her daughter is confused about what’s happening and wants to go home. Through a translator, De La Cruz said she’d told Rosa Maria that “she was only there because she was recovering, and that when she was recovered, she could come be with me.”

President Donald Trump and his administration have said their focus in immigration enforcement is on deporting criminals and protecting the border.  But Border Patrol officers also have made arrest of people not being targeted. In June, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ― which is separate from Customs and Border Protection ― said that all undocumented immigrants “should look over your shoulder, and... need to be worried.”

Both Customs and Border Protection and ICE have “sensitive locations” policies that instruct agents and officers to avoid conducting arrests or other enforcement at medical facilities, schools, places of worship and rallies.

Rosa Maria’s detention highlights not just a possible violation of the “sensitive locations” policy, but also a problem with checkpoints for many undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Border agents operate up to 100 miles away from the border, so it can be difficult for undocumented immigrants to get around ― including when they’re seeking medical treatment ― without going through checkpoints in border regions. What happened to Rosa Maria could make other undocumented immigrants more fearful about seeking help, Astrid Dominguez of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas told reporters on Thursday.

She said that CBP should change its policies at checkpoints for people seeking medical attention. In this case, Dominguez said, CBP should have used discretion “with basic humanity” and allowed the child to go back to her parents.

“Don’t believe the idea DHS propagates that it is the only law enforcement agency anywhere without discretion,” she said. “No rule should be so inflexible and no enforcement regime as harsh as” the one that traumatized Rosa Maria.

‘Jane Doe’ Got Her Abortion. Trump Policy Will Still Block Them For Other Immigrant Teens.

2017-10-25

The Trump administration implemented a new policy that obstructs undocumented teens in its custody from obtaining abortions.

WASHINGTON ― A 17-year-old undocumented immigrant was finally able to terminate her pregnancy on Wednesday morning after weeks of obstruction by the Trump administration. Jane Doe, as the girl is known in court, had an abortion after a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday afternoon that the federal government could no longer block her from leaving a shelter for the procedure.

But other undocumented minors are in similar situations. And while Jane Doe found relief, her abortion won’t immediately resolve a broader issue: The Trump administration is going to great lengths to keep minors in its custody from getting abortions.

“This is one battle in a war that we are in with the Trump administration about access to reproductive health care and attacks on immigrants and civil rights in general,” Brigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union Reproductive Freedom Project who represented the teen, told HuffPost. “What happened to Jane Doe is really symptomatic of a larger problem with the Trump administration. ... They have started with the most vulnerable, unaccompanied immigrant minors, but I have no doubt that they will try to escalate and roll back reproductive rights for many others.”

There are hundreds of pregnant immigrant minors in U.S. government custody at any given time, according to the ACLU, although it’s unknown how many are seeking abortions. The legal fight will continue for them in a class action suit to block the administration policies that prevent them from obtaining abortions.

The Trump administration blocked Jane Doe from leaving a shelter to get an abortion for a full month, stretching her pregnancy to 16 weeks, even after she received permission from a Texas state judge on Sept. 25 to make her own decision about an abortion. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which has her in its custody, had refused to allow her to leave a shelter to undergo the procedure at her own expense, although it did let her out to go to a “crisis pregnancy center” where she was urged to reconsider. Abortion is illegal in the girl’s home country.

Jane Doe said in a statement released Wednesday that it had been “very difficult” to wait in the shelter for more than a month before she was allowed to proceed.

“No one should be shamed for making the right decision for themselves,” Jane Doe said in a statement released through her guardian. “I would not tell any other girl in my situation what they should do. That decision is hers and hers alone.”

The Trump administration’s Office of Refugee Resettlement has implemented new policies to deter abortions for minors in its care. While previously office directors were involved only in decisions over whether government funding could be used for abortion, such as cases of rape, the new rules demand veto power on any abortion, even if it wouldn’t be funded by the government. The current director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement is Scott Lloyd, a former attorney for the Knights of Columbus who opposes abortion.

Lloyd personally visited a shelter to urge another unaccompanied minor to continue her pregnancy, according to the ACLU. In another case, then-Office of Refugee Resettlement acting director Ken Tota made a minor go to the emergency room after she had taken the first of two doses for a medical abortion to see if the pregnancy could be continued, according to the suit. That minor was ultimately able to complete the abortion. 

The Trump administration wrote in court filings that it has “strong and constitutionally legitimate interests in promoting childbirth, in refusing to facilitate abortion, and in not providing incentives for pregnant minors to illegally cross the border to obtain elective abortions while in federal custody.”

There is no doubt in my mind that they are going to do everything that they can to fight us not just with access for other unaccompanied minors but ... for many more women.
Brigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project
The Trump administration has argued that it is not blocking Jane Doe’s access to abortion. A government attorney said she could leave the U.S. if she wanted to undergo the procedure ― even though abortion is against the law in her native country ― or be released to a sponsor. The teen is not yet in deportation proceedings, according to her attorneys, so it is unclear whether she has legal avenues to remain in the United States. She has been in U.S. custody since early September because the government has not found her a sponsor.

The government attorney said the Justice Department was not addressing the question of whether undocumented immigrants have the constitutional right to abortion as part of the Jane Doe hearing.

A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to an inquiry on whether the Trump administration had been preparing to take the case to the Supreme Court. 

The government also argued that it should not have to “facilitate” an abortion for Jane Doe, even though its involvement would only be to approve her temporarily leaving the shelter to obtain the procedure. The same argument about facilitation could be applied to women in prison or in custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and although the government has not raised it in those situations, their rights are also a concern, Amiri said.

It also falls in line with broader efforts to curb reproductive rights under the Trump administration, she said.

“They have gone to incredible lengths to prevent Jane Doe from accessing an abortion,” Amiri said. “There is no doubt in my mind that they are going to do everything that they can to fight us not just with access for other unaccompanied minors but ... for many more women.”

One judge wrote that the Trump administration had “bulldozed over constitutional lines” by arguing that Jane Doe should be forced to leave the country if she wanted an abortion.

“Surely the mere act of entry into the United States without documentation does not mean that an immigrant’s body is no longer her or his own,” Patricia Millett, the appeals court judge, wrote. “Nor can the sanction for unlawful entry be forcing a child to have a baby. The bedrock protections of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause cannot be that shallow.”

Paul Ryan Tells Conservatives DACA Will Be Part Of Spending Deal

2017-10-24

The Speaker also said he didn’t think Obamacare subsidies would be part of the deal, but it could still be a huge win for Democrats and undocumented immigrants.
WASHINGTON ― House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) privately conceded to a group of House conservatives on Tuesday that he plans to include a legislative fix for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children in a year-end spending deal.

Asked if he envisioned a December omnibus spending bill including Cost Sharing Reductions for Obamacare or some sort of solution for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Ryan told leaders of the Republican Study Committee that he didn’t believe CSR payments would be part of the deal with Democrats, but that DACA would.

“He did talk about the fact that that would be good if we could get ahead of that as opposed to being reactionary,” RSC Chairman Mark Walker (R-N.C.) told HuffPost Tuesday night.

When HuffPost asked Walker if Ryan had said Republicans didn’t have the votes to do something on DACA alone, and therefore needed Democratic support, Walker said, “It wasn’t as clear cut as that ― and it rarely is, actually ― but he did make reference that [DACA provisions] would be something that might be part of the whole ball of wax.”

RSC Steering Committee member Rob Woodall (R-Ga.) pushed back somewhat on the idea that Ryan was saying DACA would definitely be part of a year-end deal, but he agreed that Ryan suggested Republicans needed Democratic votes.

“I would have said we were having a discussion about where the year was going, what’s left that’s out there to get done,” Woodall said. “That’s on the list of things to get done, and we just wouldn’t have the votes to do it by itself, so it would have to get combined.”

Two other Republicans, who were not part of the discussion but were briefed on it by a member who was in attendance, said they heard the speaker was clear that DACA would be part of a year-end deal. Ryan’s office did not return a request for comment.

Walker did note that the speaker was emphatic that additional border security measures would be part of any agreement legislatively codifying DACA, which President Donald Trump ended last month.

“He did talk about border security,” Walker said of Ryan. “The language that I’ve used, when we did the poll in the RSC, 83 percent of the RSC members believe that a precursor of any kind of long-term DACA fix is securing the border. Now that could be defined different ways. I didn’t get any impression that Speaker Ryan has moved off of that position.”

But Walker conceded that enhanced border security didn’t necessarily mean “a wall.”

“I don’t think that anybody has said definitively that the wall has to be part of that,” Walker said.

There is some risk in taking Ryan’s comments too seriously. What he means by DACA could differ greatly from what Democrats want or believe is an acceptable solution. Ryan could also find significant opposition from his conference ― or from the White House ― and be forced to revise his negotiating strategy.

When HuffPost asked Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) on Tuesday about Ryan potentially including DACA in a year-end spending deal, Yoho said “he better not.”

“You gotta get rid of DACA. DACA needs to go away,” Yoho said.

Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) also said it would be a “big problem” if Ryan included those immigration provisions in a December omnibus bill. “That’s true leadership, I guess,” Labrador said facetiously.

But Ryan’s private comments are significant as Republicans and Democrats begin negotiations on a year-end spending deal. If the speaker already believes DACA will be included in an omnibus bill, it would be a huge Democratic win that could make discussions more difficult for Ryan ― with his conference and with leaders on the other side of the aisle.

Trump put Republicans in this position when he announced he was ending the Obama executive action in March, throwing the fates of hundreds of thousands of undocumented young people in the hands of Congress. Suddenly, a party that had decried DACA and said they wanted a legislative solution was put in the position of either passing one or being responsible for so-called Dreamers losing their jobs and being deported.

Many Republicans have said they want to do something for Dreamers, but passing a stand-alone bill would likely only be possible if Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) chose to put a measure on the floor without majority support from their party.

Adding DACA provisions to an omnibus bill is a potential workaround, and likely the best chance for Dreamer protections to succeed, but it also still alienates many Republicans and would likely force a significant number of them to vote no, which in turn could strengthen the Democratic negotiating position on spending and other demands, like the Obamacare subsidies.

Democrats have said they will vote against the year-end spending bill if it doesn’t include legal status for young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, and Republicans don’t have enough votes to pass an omnibus bill in the Senate without at least some Democratic help.

Attaching Dreamer protections to the omnibus bill would also be a way for Republicans ― including Trump ― to save face. The president has already suggested he might act administratively if Congress fails to do anything for these immigrants. But, as Democrats have learned, anything Trump says could change quickly.

In September, Democratic leaders reported that Trump told them he would agree to Dreamer protections in exchange for border security, but Trump later reneged on that deal, and some White House staffers have tried to thwart an agreement by asking for demands that are unreasonable to Democrats.

Senate Republicans are reportedly working on a deal of their own that would include Dreamer protections along with other measures. But in the House, while Ryan created a working group to find a deal on Dreamers, he also included members who staunchly oppose legal status for undocumented immigrants.

Although Trump and some lawmakers have said they have until March of next year to act, the reality is that some Dreamers are already suffering from Trump’s decision to rescind DACA. If Congress doesn’t act, the situation will become even more dramatic on March 6; no DACA recipient whose permits expire after March 5 will able to renew them, so Dreamers will begin to lose protections in large numbers, forcing them to leave their jobs and putting them at risk of being detained and deported.

Democrats have said they’re willing to agree to certain border security measures ― though not a wall ― in exchange for a DACA deal. If Dreamer measures were part of a broader government spending bill, lawmakers could say they also got immigration enforcement funding as part of the package and both sides could claim some victories. But it’s clear that Democrats would believe they won the negotiations, even as Republicans in a number of swing districts would be blamed for any inaction.

Passing Dreamer measures is broadly popular. A Fox News poll in September found that 62 percent of voters said it was either extremely or very important for Congress to approve such a bill, and 86 percent believed Dreamers should be allowed to stay in the country.

Donald Trump Imposes New Restrictions On Refugees

2017-10-24

He says he wants stricter vetting on one of the most highly vetted populations in the world.

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump restarted the U.S. refugee resettlement program on Tuesday after a 120-day suspension but added new vetting requirements and another review period that will make it harder and slower for vulnerable people to come to the United States.

For many refugees, the suspension of refugee resettlement will effectively continue. Trump ordered a 90-day review of procedures and security in 11 countries, which officials declined to name publicly. During that time, refugees will be allowed to resettle only if it’s deemed to be in the national interest of the U.S.

Trump also halted the program that allows family members to reunite with refugees already resettled in the U.S. The delay is until unnamed security measures have been implemented, which will affect individuals of all nationalities. And all refugees will be subject to the additional screening, including requirements that they provide information about their location for the past decade, Reuters reported.  

The increased vetting measures were deemed “adequate to generally, broadly resume refugee admissions” by officials at the departments of State and Homeland Security, along with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, DHS spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said Tuesday.

He said government officials determined that 11 countries needed additional consideration. He and other officials noted to reporters that the 11 countries were designated areas of concern that would require stricter vetting in 2015 ― likely a defense against arguments that Trump’s latest refugee order is a veiled effort to keep Muslims out of the country, as he vowed to do on the campaign trail.

Although the government did not identify the countries, as of the end of 2016 there were higher security vetting requirements for adult males from 11 nations, according to Reuters: Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, along with some Palestinians.

The government anticipates the requirements will make it slower for refugees of all nationalities to go through the screening process, although a senior administration official said they did not have estimates because the time periods vary. The security and background check that refugees in the resettlement pipeline undergo already involves a wide variety of federal agencies and takes at least 18 months.

The Trump administration plans to admit up to 45,000 refugees in the 2018 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1 ― the lowest-ever cap on resettlement.

“Today’s announcement makes the pattern undeniable. The Trump administration is seeking to dismantle the refugee resettlement program brick by brick, through any means necessary,” Rev. John McCullough, the president of refugee resettlement organization Church World Service, said in a statement. 

Officials declined to go into detail about the new screening measures, citing security and law enforcement concerns. They will require applicants to provide additional information and give those conducting screening more training and flexibility to detect fraud and determine if people are inadmissible, Jennifer Higgins, associate director of the Refugee, Asylum and International Operations Directorate at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told reporters. She said they will also expand the review process for some applicants, including social media checks.

“The security of the American people, of course, is our highest priority,” Higgins said on the administration’s call with reporters. “The vetting and screening enhancements that the U.S. refugee admissions program is implementing ensures that the United States can continue to admit eligible refugees while also protecting the national security and welfare of the United States.”

A State Department memo obtained by Reuters said that all refugees would be required to provide “phone, email and address information going back ten years instead of five” for anywhere they lived for more than 30 days. Refugees will also be required to give current phone and email addresses for all family members, rather than just those with connections to the U.S., Reuters reported.

A government official told reporters that the process will still focus on vulnerability versus other factors for determining whom to admit, and remains “committed to nondiscrimination.” 

Refugees who already made it to the U.S. have struggled with the previous system, which already made it difficult for them to reunite with their families.

The U.S. family reunification program faced complaints over its narrow definition of who constituted family. It applies only to children, spouses or parents of the person making the request. And those children must be under the age of 21. This means that a refugee in the U.S. has no legal pathway to reunite with a sibling.

Sana Mustafa, a Syrian who claimed asylum in the U.S. in 2014, petitioned to reunite with her mother and sisters, who fled to Turkey. Since none of them could qualify under the reunification requirements, they decided to attempt going through the resettlement pipeline. They were denied earlier this year. Now, she said, they remain in Turkey, where refugees cannot legally work or attend school.

Rahim Hamid, 31, an Iranian refugee who was resettled in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2015, is also at a loss over what to do about his sister-in-law, he told HuffPost. She and her husband, Iranian refugees living in Turkey, applied to reunite with Hamid and his wife but were rejected after Trump entered office. They appealed earlier this year and were rejected again.

“They even didn’t give any clear justification or explanation why they have been denied,” Hamid said. “There is no solution. They are stranded in Turkey.”

A limited version of Trump’s ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries went into effect following a Supreme Court decision in June. This allowed a 120-day suspension of the refugee program to be enacted, along with a 90-day ban on travel from all non-visa holders from those countries. Trump attempted to impose yet another travel ban in September that wouldn’t have affected the refugee program, but it was struck down in federal court last week.
