After Democrats win big in Virginia, Trump turns on GOP candidate

2017-11-08

The Democrats took the governership of Virginia and wiped out Republican control of its House of Delegates tuesday. Among the winning candidates are Danica Roem, Virginia's first trans person to be elected, who thrashed the state's most outspoken enemy of LGBT people. After Republican Gillespie lost the governorship to Democrat Ralph Northam, President Trump immediately turned on his party's candidate.


Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Don’t forget, Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!



Another reminder to Republicans that Trump knows no party but one that wins in his name.

Trump's base will always love him, and do not care what he promised

2017-11-08

Politico sent Michael Kruse to a run-down pit town in Pennsylvania to see if Trump voters there are happy with his presidency so far. They're still with him, they don't care about his promises, and don't care that he's constantly golfing and tweeting. They just like the way he talks about the people they hate, and "boy oh boy do they hate kneeling NFL players."

Twitter briefly and immeasurably improved by removal of Donald Trump

2017-11-03

On their last day at Twitter, an outgoing employee shut down Donald Trump's account. It was dead for a few minutes, the internet exploding in shock and vain hope. Then someone restored it.

Through our investigation we have learned that this was done by a Twitter customer support employee who did this on the employee’s last day. We are conducting a full internal review. https://t.co/mlarOgiaRF



The few, whose understanding of free speech is limited to a formless, angry entitlement to the accounts they are given on privately-owned media company websites, think Trump was censored.

The many know a hero when they see one.

Former Trump aide admits lying to FBI over Russia contacts

2017-10-30

Though Paul Manafort's indictment was top of the ticket, it's the guilty plea of Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos that's proving bigger news today. Paladopoulos not only admits he lied to FBI agents about his contacts with people close to the Russian government in search of "dirt" on Trump's opponent in the 2016 presidential race, but is described as a co-operating witness. For anti-Trump folks who feared too much was being made of too little, it's a dream come true. Jeer Heer: "a member of Trump’s campaign has pled guilty and provided evidence that the campaign did collude or attempt to collude with Russia. That cuts to the heart of the Mueller investigation—and it means that the president should be in very deep trouble."
