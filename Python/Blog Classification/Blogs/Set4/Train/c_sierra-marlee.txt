SNL’s Alec Baldwin Victim-Shames Rose McGowan, Quits Twitter

2017-11-31

Y’all, it’s finally happened. Yes, the liberal blowhard Alec Baldwin has had his last meltdown, and left Twitter. (Hopefully for good, but people like him need his ego stroked regularly so don’t expect this to be a permanent thing.)

Though if and when he comes back, even liberals will find themselves unable to support him. You see, his last action before quitting social media was to victim-shame Rose McGowan, who we all know by now lead the digital charge against Harvey Weinstein following the report of his sexual harassment of actresses.

Way to make yourself unappealing to literally every decent human on the planet, Alec. Hope you’re not planning to work any time in the near… ever.

Alec Baldwin

Baldwin appeared on PBS on Friday (does anyone actually still watch PBS?) in which he admitted that he had heard that Rose McGowan was being raped by Harvey Weinstein, but did nothing about it.

When the interviewer broached the subject that while it seems “everyone knew” about the sexual violence taking place in Hollywood, nobody actually stood up for any of the victims. Alec defended himself by saying he never went to the authorities because Rose McGowan had taken a $100,000 settlement in 1997.

He later admits that he didn’t know until just recently that she had taken the settlement. You know, in case you needed yet another reason to hate this low-life piece of human garbage.

“What happened was that Rose McGowan took a payment of $100,000 and settled her case with him, and it was for Rose McGowan to prosecute that case … I had no idea, until now, that she had settled the case … Do the settlement of these cases hurt the cause of exposing and bringing us to a place of real change?” Baldwin asked. “When women take money and are silenced by that money, even though they took the money and were silenced because they were told, beyond the money, it was the right thing for them to do — keep quiet, don’t make too many waves, it is going to hurt your career. When they do it, nonetheless, does it set back the cause of change?”

First of all, you cretin, McGowan was 23-years-old at the time that Weinstein began assaulting her. The fact that you didn’t do a damn thing to help an innocent girl who just wanted to make it in Hollywood is disgusting.

It should also be known that during the 90s while this was happening, the media and Weinstein’s good friends the Clintons were busy bashing women who were accusing the President of sexual misconduct and rape. It wasn’t exactly a friendly atmosphere for female victims to accuse men of standing of being inappropriate.

And so what if she took the money? That doesn’t make her any less of a victim, you absolute and utter scourge.

Oh, but now that she’s speaking up, Rose won’t be shut up. She took to Twitter to bash Baldwin.

Saudi Arabia Arrests 11 Princes and Dozens of Former Ministers In Corruption Crackdown

2017-11-20

Things are happening in Saudi Arabia, and it has Americans everywhere cheering because despite what Hillary Clinton or others might tell you, they are not our friends.

On Saturday, King Salman ordered the arrest of 11 princes and dozens of former ministers, among which was billionaire Trump-critic Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, who has invested in multiple American companies including Twitter and Citigroup.



The arrests come as the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was chosen to oversee an anti-corruption probe in which all of the arrested were named as suspects.

According to local media, the committee that will be looking into the group with regards to the deadly flooding the overtook parts of the city of Jiddah in 2009 as well as the government’s response to the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) virus that has killed hundreds in the past few years.

Saudi Arabia’s top council of clerics confirmed that they had permission to detain the higher-level officials because it is their “Islamic duty” to fight corruption, basically meaning Allah ordained the arrests.

Royal order indicates that this anti-corruption committee was created “due to the propensity of some people for abuse, putting their personal interest above public interest, and stealing public funds.” It will be allowed to trace funds, issue arrest warrants, impose travel restrictions, prevent the transfer of funds or the liquidation of assets, and freeze bank accounts.

A number of officials have also been replaced in their duties by the king.

Prince Miteb bin Abdullah was the head of the National Guard, and has since been replaced by Prince Khalid bin Ayyaf al-Muqrin who, until now, had only served in a senior post with the Guard.

Minister of Economy and Planning Adel Fakeih was replaced by his deputy Mohammad al-Tuwaijri, and the commander of Saudi Naval Forces Admiral Abdullah Al-Sultan was removed from his position, with Admiral Fahd bin Abdullah Al-Ghifaili taking his place.

This could be really good for the king as far as replacing old power with new, but it could also end badly as there can be negative consequences when you try to do too much too quickly. It’s like trying to pull too many blocks out of the Jenga tower too fast, eventually it will all collapse but moving too fast will speed that along.

Whatever the case may be, this is something that Americans should keep our eye on. We have a lot of connections to Saudi Arabia, and they might be affected by this anti-corruption investigation.

Egyptian cleric; Islam says men can marry their own daughters if they are born out of wedlock

2017-11-29

I have never heard something so disgustingly wrong in my entire life, and keep in mind I’ve listened to MSNBC for hours while in a hospital waiting room. THAT right there should tell you everything you need to know about how awful this statement is.

The fact that it’s coming from a religious leader makes it even worse, but when you remember that it’s Islam, it suddenly makes a little more sense.



Prominent Egyptial Salafist cleric Mazen Al-Sersawi believes that the religion of Islam allows men to have sex with their own daughters, and even marry them, provided those children are born out of wedlock.

I wish I were kidding because the thought of someone actually taking this guy seriously makes me sick to my stomach, but the video of him making these claims has gone viral and while he has been widely criticized for his comments, he is not a “prominent” cleric because nobody listens to him.

The fact that he teaches at Al-Azhar University in Egypt is worse.

He says that any daughter born out of an adulterous relationship is not really a man’s daughter, so if he wants to take her as a bride, then that is completely acceptable. It is because the young girl does not carry the man’s name that “she is not his daughter according to Sharia. She is not officially attributed to him.”

The video itself was made in 2012, but was recently brought back into the forefront with women everywhere expressing mutual disgust at the idea that a man be allowed to marry and have sex with his own daughter.

But this is apparently a normal topic of discussion among Egyptian Muslims. Earlier this year, Muftah Mohammad Maarouf argued that the age of marriage should be low enough for newborn babies to be able to be married off to any man who chooses them. Yes, you read that correctly.

Oh, but as long as no harm comes to the child, it should be totally okay for her to be married off. As a newborn. Whose idea of consent is non-existent.

If you needed any more proof that this is the most backwards religion in the world, this should be it. The first world should not stand for this. Babies shouldn’t be married before they can walk, children should not become the sexual slaves of their fathers, and little boys should not be raise with the idea that if they kill others and themselves in the name of their religion, they will be rewarded with virgins in the afterlife. Everything about this is wrong.

Liberals Lose Their Mind Over Signs on College Campuses That Say ‘It’s Okay To Be White’

2017-11-02

In a time where progressives everywhere are attacking being white as the root of all evil, being okay with your whiteness is now viewed as dangerous. In fact, it has many liberals running for their safe spaces.

Signs that say “It’s OK To Be White” have been popping up all over the place, leaving at least one college student feeling “threatened.” One of the schools where the pieces of paper have appeared is launching an “investigation” into the matter.

This goes to show how backwards things have become in America. Saying “you’re not a bad person just because you’re white” is now something that needs to be investigated. Personally, I feel more threatened by Professors who decry “whiteness” on a daily basis and use skin color as a way to exclude people from certain discussions, but perhaps that’s just me.



The world is so backwards that posting signs like this is considered to be inciting “racial, political tensions” according to media outlets.

While I disagree that this is something that is worth “investigating,” it does appear that this was planned somewhere and carried out by a large number of people. Whether it was intended to cause unrest or not (I suspect it was) there is no reason that people should be tearing down signs that say “It’s OK To Be White,” because the message is not wrong. There is nothing wrong with being any race. The fact that this is upsetting to some people shows that while we have made a lot of progress in race relations, we still have a long way to go.

If you’re one of those people who get triggered by inanimate pieces of paper that tell white people that they’re not horrible for being white, you should be asking yourself why. I mean, really, why does it bother you that white people are sick of being attacked for something we can’t control? Why does it bother you that others want to make them feel safe and valid? If this actually troubles you, maybe you should seek out therapy, because it’s clear that you have some unresolved issues.

Making someone feel bad about their race is so 1960s. Let’s live in the future where it’s okay to be whatever race you’re born as, okay? And the people taking down these signs are part of the problem. Way to make white people feel attacked, guys. Very progressive of you.

Celebrity Mila Kunis Donations to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence’s Name cause Jim Beam Boycott

2017-11-30

Despite the recent peek into the dark underworld of Hollywood, it would appear that some actors and actresses are going to stay the course with their attempts to alienate conservatives and Republicans. Kind of ironic, since they need all of the support that they can get right now, right?

But actress Mila Kunis decided to take to Conan O’Brian’s late night talk show and joke about how she donates money to abortion chain Planned Parenthood under Vice President Mike Pence’s name. Naturally, this lead to a boycott of one of the more popular products she advertises for: Jim Beam.



Conan asked her to explain her little “prank” to the audience, undoubtedly knowing that she should receive some major backlash because of her comments.

“I apologize if I’m offending anybody,” she said, preparing to offend people anyway. “It’s not so much a prank as much as I disagreed with some of the stuff that Pence was doing and was trying to do. And so as a reminder that there are women out there in the world that may or may not agree with his platform, I put him on a list of recurring donations that are made in his name to Planned Parenthood.”

“Every month, to his office, he gets a little letter that says like, “An anonymous donation has been made in your name.” I don’t look at it as a prank, this is like, I strongly disagree, and this is my little way of doing it,” she explained. “It’s a peaceful protest.”

In case you missed all that shenanigans, you can watch her comments below:

Great, right?

Because you’re not allowed to have a personal opinion as the Vice President without some random actress spamming your office with monthly reminders that she supports the murder of babies.

But as Kunis received praise from liberal circles, conservatives took to Twitter to remind the little lady just who is in charge here.

Now is she going to issue an apology for her offense in an attempt to save her job with Jim Beam? Probably. Is she actually going to mean it? Not a chance.

This is unfortunate because Kunis is a talented actress who I have loved for many years, but I can no longer support someone with whom I disagree so fundamentally. Abortion is murder and the fact that you continue to fund it (especially under another person’s name) is something that I can’t get past.

Major U.S, City Has Become One Where It Is TABOO To Have A Republican Friend

2017-11-05

Why would anyone who isn’t an avowed socialist want to live in Seattle, Washington? I ask this because one of the city council members, Kshama Sawant, is a self-described socialist who has actually incited riots before. That should tell you everything you need to know about the city, but in case you’re morbidly curious, allow me to expose you to the toxic side of Seattle politics.

While the rest of the United States – that being the 95% of us who are still sane and don’t want civil war – just wants to find a way to come together, there are people like Sawant who prefer to think of her political opponents as her enemies. Now, it appears that it has become taboo for the liberals of Seattle to admit that they have Republican friends.



While in the middle of a debate about the state of the juvenile justice system in their city, Tim Burgess (Democrat) tried to show how important the issue is by invoking bi-partisanship. He spoke of how “even our Republican friends” have been calling for changes to the system, but Sawant took issue with his statement.

She stood up and declared that Burgess didn’t speak for her, because she didn’t have any Republican friends.

And then, wait for it, the crowd CHEERED. They actually applauded a woman who is proud of living in an echo chamber, where the only diversity allowed is different ways of bringing out the socialist agenda. That right there tells you everything you need to know about the city. She was simply expressing the opinions held by many of the people in attendance and that should frighten everyone.

I personally have friends all over the political aisle. I have friends who voted for Sanders, Clinton, Trump, third-party and I even have friends who didn’t vote at all for personal reasons, and these are all people who I am proud to call my friends. Each and every one of them has a special place in my heart as a human being. We may not agree on politics, but that’s perfectly fine because there is so much more to the world and to being a person than our political beliefs.

It’s heart-breaking that liberals – who tout diversity at every turn – would be so gleeful at voluntarily excluding diversity of thought from their ranks. I’m not saying that you have to be best buds with a white supremacist, or that you should be friends with people who are abusive to you over political differences, but to intentionally shut out a person for no reason other than being *insert political affiliation here* is absurd and it’s wrong.

State To Allow Children To Choose Their Race And Gender – Yes, Really

2017-11-29

Call me a conspiracy theorist all you want, but the longer I live, the more convinced I become that we’re in some kind of life simulator and the people in control ran out of ideas in 2000 and now they’re just throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. You know, kind of like when you’re playing a video game and you’re trying to make the ugliest possible character instead of one that looks like you?

Well, the example of that I’m bringing before you today (because every day is something new on the never-ending rollercoaster of liberalism) is Delaware now allowing children to be able to choose their gender.

Oh, and race. [Laughs in Rachel Dolezal.]



Yes, a new proposal seems to indicate that children can identify as any gender and race they choose. No, really.

According to Section 7.4: “All students enrolled in a Delaware public school may self-identify gender or race which is maintained in eSchoolPLUS.”

Section 7.4.1 gets into more detail.

“Prior to requesting permission from a parent or legal guardian, the school should consult and work closely with the student to assess the degree to which, if any, the parent or legal guardian is aware of the Protected Characteristic and is supportive of the student, and the school shall take into consideration the safety, health and well-being of the student in deciding whether to request permission from the parent or legal guardian,” it reads. For reference, these “Protected Characteristics” it mentions are things like race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, gender identity and anything else you can imagine that would make one a special little snowflake.

Basically, the government knows best and if they deem that your child is “different” and you don’t support that, well then you’re just a bigot who is in violation of the new anti-discrimination rules.

Delaware Family Policy Council President Nicole Theis said that this absolutely scares the living daylights out of her.

“Literally, if a parent affirms their child’s biological sex, and now race, they are positioned as discriminatory through policies like Regulation 225,” she said. “These policies are setting parents up as a ‘non-ally’ and unsupportive, even abusive, if they affirm their child’s biological realities and work through confusion versus embracing it.”

She thinks the policies are positively Orwellian and that is not a good thing. You are born the way you are. This isn’t a video game, you don’t get to change things about yourself based on how you feel. That’s not how any of this works.

Elizabeth Warren Throws Hillary Clinton Under The Bus – She’s Been Exposed

2017-11-01

It would appear that the expulsion of Hillary Clinton is taking its first steps among the Democratic party.

After Donna Brazile admitted that her investigation into the DNC email hack informed her that Hillary Clinton’s campaign was basically running the Democrat bank account, she was forced to also acknowledge how deeply in debt their party was following the election.

Now, Hillary Clinton is facing fire from all sides, including people she could have considered allies at one point.

Like Elizabeth Warren.



Yes, now even Fauxcahontas is being forced to throw Hillary under the bus, reverse Thelma & Louise style. In a CNN interview with the always-moderate Jake Tapper, Warren actually admitted that Hillary rigged the election.

I know, I know, take some time to catch your breath, because it gets better.

Tapper began the interview by asking about some of the things that Brazile mentioned, including the agreement between Dems and Clinton to have her “control day-to-day operations at the DNC. The Clinton campaign controlling the party’s staffing, strategy, finances, communications and that agreement was entered into in August 2015, a year before she defeated Sen. Bernie Sanders.”

“This is a real problem,” she admitted. “But what we’ve got to do as Democrats now is we’ve got to hold this party accountable. When Tom Perez was first elected chair of the DNC, the very first conversation I had with him is to say, ‘You have got to put together a Democratic Party in which everybody can have confidence that the party is working for Democrats rather than Democrats are working for the party.’ And he’s being tested now.”

She’s absolutely right. This revelation is going to tear the Democratic Party right down the middle and push a lot of people away, if it hasn’t already. Now that the party is being forced to admit their secret dealings, it’s all about to come unraveled.

“This is a test for Tom Perez.,” she continued. “And either he’s going to succeed by bringing Bernie Sanders and Bernie Sanders’s representatives into this process and they’re going to say it’s fair, it works, we all believe it, or he’s going to fail. And I very much hope he succeeds. I hope for Democrats everywhere. I hope for Bernie and for all of Bernie’s supporters that he’s going to succeed.”

And the final blow? Tapper asked if Warren believed that the process was rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton. Her response? A simple and concise “Yes.”

NFL Team Invites Navy Veteran To Game Thinking He’d Accept Their Invitation With Open Arms – NOPE

2017-11-13

In what appears to me to be a pathetically transparent way to combat claims that the National Football League is disrespecting the country and veterans, they asked a Navy Veteran to attend a game where he would be honored publicly for his service with a special award.

It turns out, though, that you can’t just put a pretty bow on a garbage bag and call it a present. Cmdr. John Wells turned down the invitation immediately and wasn’t shy about letting people know exactly why it was that he refused to show up at this or any football game.



In an interview about the matter with local media, Wells made it clear that he does not respect an institution that does not respect America.

“I am unable, in good conscience, to enter an NFL stadium while this discourtesy prevails,” he wrote.

“I had hoped and prayed that the NFL would outlaw these disgraceful protests and wanted to give the commissioner and the owners a fair opportunity to do so,” he continued. “Their failure to act is a slap in the face to all of those who have served in uniform. Men and women have fought and died for the flag that the players are disrespecting.”

He is backed by millions of Americans who refused to continue watching any NFL games, including those who used to live, breathe and die for their team.

We have been saying that these protests are disrespectful to America and vets, but liberals claim that it’s not supposed to be. They claim that they are trying to bring awareness to their social causes but all they’re doing successfully is alienating people who view this as an attention-grabbing stunt. The National Anthem, the flag, love of country and the ideals that it stands for, these are all things that should bring us together and unite us in spite of our differences, from minute to vast. We should be able to squabble all day and half the night about our problems, and be able to stand side by side to honor a country that allows us to hash our differences out (or not) and do so freely. It’s unfortunate that the left sees fit to trash one of the few things that I personally thought was okay to hold sacred.

To be fair, it is simply a natural progression of their agenda. First it was the nuclear family, then it was education and now it is patriotism. We need to pray for them. It’s the only thing that may be able to stop their evil mission.
