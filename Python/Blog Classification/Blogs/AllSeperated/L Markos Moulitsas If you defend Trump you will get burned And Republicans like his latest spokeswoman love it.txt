If you defend Trump, you will get burned. And Republicans (like his latest spokeswoman) love it!

it’s a story as old as … donald trump’s first forays into the republican primary, and it goes like this: the popular-vote loser lies. his staff and surrogates rise up to defend him. a couple of hours later, trump changes his story, leaving his defenders high and dry, looking like the fools that they are. 

and of course, we just saw that with the firing of fbi director james comey. the official explanation was that he was fired for his handling of the hillary clinton email investigation. most people laughed, but his lieutenants and sycophants dutifully rose to defend him. then, in the middle of their defenses, trump came out and admitted it was all bullshit, firing comey to obstruct the investigation into his election collusion with russia. so how does his spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders explain blatantly lying to the country?

so according to her, everything coming out of her mouth is made-up bullshit if she hasn’t met with the president. so does the press has to ask, “is your answer made-up bullshit, or have you actually spoken directly with the president?” 

obviously, this excuse is laughable. this isn’t someone overly concerned with lying on trump’s behalf, no matter how supposedly christian her upbringing might’ve been. (her father is part of the american taliban.) but it shows, once again, that if you get in bed with trump, you will get burned.
