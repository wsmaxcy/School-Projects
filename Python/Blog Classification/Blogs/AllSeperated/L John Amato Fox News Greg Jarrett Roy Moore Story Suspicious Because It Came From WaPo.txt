Fox News' Greg Jarrett: Roy Moore Story Suspicious Because It Came From WaPo

2017-11-10

fox news' gregg jarrett believes moore is unfit to be a senator because of his prior actions in politics, but questions the credibility of the "sex allegations" because it came from the washington post.

during a broadcast of fox news' hannity on thursday night, the roy moore deplorable apology team was out in full force.

about 15 minutes in, gregg jarrett told hannity he thought roy moore should be disqualified to run for the senate seat because of "defying federal judicial decisions on constitutional matters which he is not allowed to do under the supremacy clause..."

however, about those pesky sex allegations.

"having said that, " greg said.

"i am suspicious of this because of the source, the washington post, which has a dog in this fight having endorsed his opponent. the timing of it on the eve of an election. and finally, he was a huge and has been a huge public figure in alabama, the best known son of alabama in many ways, and yet none of this came to surface in almost four decades. and so that gives me reason to question the credibility of these people, " jarrett said.

the washington post's record reporting on the trump administration has been pretty stellar so far -- no matter what trump, kellyanne conway or sarah huckabee sanders say -- and the moore story is verified by multiple witnesses.

these are detailed accounts of moore's actions by women who didn't know each other. and they did not remain anonymous, either.

however, it is so easy for the right-wing media to tar a story because of the messenger. but wapo is not a breitbart/infowars propaganda site or a sean hannity state-sponsored trump tv.

and for a man like moore, who's acted like an unhinged religious zealot for his own self-interests and has shown he does not respect the rule of law - doesn't this sound any alarm bells for you, greg?
