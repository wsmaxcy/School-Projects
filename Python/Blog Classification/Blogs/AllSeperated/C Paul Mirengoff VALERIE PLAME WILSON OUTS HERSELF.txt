VALERIE PLAME WILSON �OUTS� HERSELF

2017-09-21

remember valerie plame wilson? she is, to quote red state, �the former faux deep cover, non-official cover cia analyst� who was not �outed� by scooter libby.

today, plame re-tweeted with obvious approval an anti-jewish rant in something called the unz review by phillip giraldi, the headline of which is �america�s jews are driving america�s wars.� as noah pollak has shown, giraldi is �a conspiracy theorist obsessed with jews and israel.� in his warped view, �scratching the surface of almost any event exposes the sinister machinations of international jewry.�

the piece that plame re-tweeted is consistent with this description. giraldi maintains that �jewish groups and deep pocket individual donors not only control the politicians, they own and run the media and entertainment industries.� he rejects as �a sham� the notion that these jews have a �duel loyalty,� arguing that �some of them only have real loyalty to israel.�

according to giraldi, jews use their control over politicians and the media to drive america into war. he proposes �a couple of simple fixes for the dominant involvement of american jews in foreign policy issues where they have a personal interest due to their ethnicity or family ties.�

first, �don�t put them into national security positions involving the middle east, where they will potentially be conflicted.� second, when certain jews appear on television, the media should be required to label them at the bottom of the television screen whenever they pop up, e.g. bill kristol is �jewish and an outspoken supporter of the state of israel.�

giraldi charmingly compares this to �a warning label on a bottle of rat poison � translating roughly as �ingest even the tiniest little dosage of the nonsense spewed by bill kristol at your own peril.�� i compare it to wearing a yellow star.

when, naturally, plame was called for re-tweeted giraldi�s odious attack, plame defended what she had done. she tweeted:

first of all, calm down. re-tweets don�t imply endorsement. yes, very provocative, but thoughtful. many neocon hawks are jewish.

she also tweeted:

read the entire article and try, just for a moment, to put aside your biases and think clearly.

before long, however, plame back-tracked. she did so through a series of unpersuasive claims.

she stated:

ok folks, look, i messed up. i skimmed this piece, zeroed in on the neocon criticism, and shared it without seeing and considering the rest.

but, having instructed folks to �read the entire article,� it will hardly do for plame to claim she did not do so herself. surely, moreover, she read the title � america�s jews are driving america�s wars. it speaks of american jews, not �neocons.�

plame also blamed her re-tweet on the fact that she was moving. she said:

on a personal note, one should not tweet while moving, 8 workmen are in a small space, the dog is going nuts, and kids are texting one asking for things they forgot for school. social media very unforgiving.

multi-tasking can be challenging. but it was plame�s decision to take on the task of re-tweeting obviously anti-jewish content.

it turns out, moreover, that plame has re-tweeted anti-semitic material from the unz review in the past. for example, in 2015, following then-candidate trump�s claim that american muslims were celebrating the fall of the twin towers on 9/11, the unz review published a piece entitled �the dancing israelis,� claiming that some people celebrating the attack were israeli. �trump was right about 9/11,� the subtitle said, �but they weren�t muslims.�

plame tweeted a link to the post, writing �i never heard this story about 9/11.�

plame has also re-tweeted articles by giraldi, according to bre payton of the federalist. in 2015, she shared a link to a post criticizing the role of jewish people serving in congress. �war inside the beltway,� the headline read. �israeli-occupied congress confronts the white house.�

giraldi complained that �most of the congressmen being quoted in the media are jewish and are openly stating their concern for israel while the media is uncritically accepting that as a reasonable position.� plame commended article, particularly the bit about former cia director james woolsey being a �fully owned parasite hovering in a regular neocon orbit. . .�

was plame moving that day too?

plame�s excuses for re-tweeting giraldi�s latest rant border on the absurd and her belated apology is surely insincere. plame, the long-time darling of the american left, has outed herself as an anti-semite.
