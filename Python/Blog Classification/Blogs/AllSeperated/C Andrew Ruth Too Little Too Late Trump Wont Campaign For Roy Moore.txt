Too Little Too Late? Trump Won’t Campaign For Roy Moore

2017-11-27

a white house official confirmed monday that president trump will not campaign for controversial gop candidate roy moore prior to alabama’s special election on dec. 12.

breaking: white house official: trump will not campaign for embattled alabama senate candidate roy moore before dec. 12 election.
but given trump’s past statements questioning moore’s accusers, it seems a lot like closing the barn door after the livestock already ran off.

trump has had weeks and ample opportunity to pressure moore to drop out as the senate candidate as allegations against him sexually harassing, abusing and pursuing minors continue to mount.

the time has unfortunately passed for trump to make any real impact on the election by allowing an alternate candidate to step in. leaving republicans in the uncomfortable position of voting for moore or seeing a democrat take the seat.
