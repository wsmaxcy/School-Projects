OUR UNDER-INCARCERATION PROBLEM, MARYLAND/DELAWARE EDITION

2017-10-18
america has an under-incarceration problem. too many people whose history of criminality shows they should be in jail are on our streets committing crimes, including heinous ones. i�ve written about this here, here, here, and elsewhere.

today�s news brings more evidence of the problem. radee l. prince killed three co-workers and wounded two others at his workplace in northern maryland and then drove to delaware where he shot a sixth victim. police apprehended him early this evening after a manhunt.

the shootings occurred only hours ago, and prince�s full criminal record has not yet been reported. however, he has a lengthy criminal history in both maryland and delaware, according to court records and law enforcement officials.

wilmington police chief robert tracy says that in delaware alone, prince has a total of 42 arrests, including 15 convictions for felonies and several for misdemeanors. that�s quite a record for a 37 year-old.

prince has also had trouble with the law in maryland. for example, in 2015 he was pulled over for driving with his front headlight out, and became �extremely loud and aggressive,� according to court records. police found a pistol in the card, and prince was charged with multiple handgun violations. however, prosecutors dropped these charges three months later.

earlier this year, prince was fired from a job in maryland for punching a co-worker and threatening other employees. as far as i can tell, he was not prosecuted for this, and a judge declined to issue a �peace order� when another co-worker applied for one.

we don�t know yet whether prince has committed drug offenses. reportedly, however, he has been ordered in recent years to undergo counseling for drug abuse.

i probably will have more to say about prince as additional information about his history becomes available. but even with what we now know, it seems almost certain that, in a properly functioning criminal justice system, this 15-time loser with a recent history of violence against co-workers would have been behind bars when the day began, and lives would have been spared.
