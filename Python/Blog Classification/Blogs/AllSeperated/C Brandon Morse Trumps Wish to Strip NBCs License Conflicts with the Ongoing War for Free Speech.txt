Trump's Wish to Strip NBC's License Conflicts with the Ongoing War for Free Speech

2017-10-11

there's nothing i appreciate about trump's presidency more than his war against the media. every day is a new smack in the continuous slap fight between the oval office and the mainstream media. like dr. ishiro serizawa from godzilla i stand on the sidelines, utterly fascinated, muttering "let them fight" as the titanic slugfest plays out before me.
after the mutual boot licking we witnessed for eight years during the obama administration, it warms my heart to see the media's hubris challenged, mocked, and dismantled by the oval office itself. yes, it sometimes gets overly ridiculous, and maybe even sometimes more than a little embarrassing, but trump's bloviating has thrown the media on its rear more times than not.
as a result, i've never seen a harder push against the mainstream media occur since the days of andrew breitbart, god rest his badass soul.
i don't just throw this praise out lightly. anyone who knows me, or has followed my work, knows i'm no fan of trump, but i promised to praise him when he deserved it, and lambast him when he really deserved it.
today, he really deserves it.
earlier today, prompted by an nbc report about trump's desire for a beefier nuclear arsenal, trump wondered aloud via twitter if nbc should have its license stripped because of all the fake news they throw at us. while it obviously earned the ire of anyone who was already going to trash him even if he said something along the lines of �i love puppies,� it also ran afoul of the right.
