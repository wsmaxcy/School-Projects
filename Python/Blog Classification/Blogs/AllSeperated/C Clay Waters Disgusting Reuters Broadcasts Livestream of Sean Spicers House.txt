Disgusting: Reuters Broadcasts Livestream of Sean Spicer’s House

2017-07-21

roughly two hours after white house press secretary sean spicer announced his resignation, reuters disturbingly set up shop outside spicer’s house and provided a livestream for viewers to follow along with. 

it doesn’t take a whole lot of decency to conclude that this is a disgusting and tasteless display by an organization who’s white house correspondent (jeff mason) is the president of the white house correspondents association (whca). one has to wonder if mason thinks this is good journalism.

as of 2:15 p.m. eastern, there were zero signs of movement inside spicer’s virginia house. this being said, the debasing, paparazzi-like behavior by reuters has actually given the american people a valuable takeaway, which is just now little the media take this seriously. 

for the liberal media, they couldn’t be any more overjoyed by the chaos at the white house. friday marked another day of fun and games for the media with spicer acting as another notch in their belt as their warpath to remove president trump from office drags on.
