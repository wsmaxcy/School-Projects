JOIN THE NATIONAL CIVIC ART SOCIETY FOR A CLASSICAL TOUR OF WASHINGTON, D.C.

2017-05-19

in my spare time, i serve on the volunteer board of the national civic art society, an excellent organization headquartered in washington, d.c. and focused on enforcing aesthetic standards in public architecture. readers won�t be surprised to learn that the federal government lavishes tens of millions on �starchitects� of low taste and great fame on the global capital cocktail circuit.

this summer, the society is going to run a series of architectural tours of washington �� a city which is, architecturally speaking, halfway between heaven and hell �� with noted historian and architect michael curtis, whose book on the architecture of washington will be published in november this year by the history press. the tours are essentially free, although you do need to plump $10 to reserve your spot.

as the ncas puts it:

these tours are fashioned for those who wish a greater under- standing of why and how the district of columbia came to be a classically designed city. you will learn of the ancient antecedents of our political philosophies, of the stylistic precedents of our architectural forms, and of the founders� classical vision.

the roster of those tours and the schedule for the entire series of the society�s �our classical heritage� tours can be viewed here, where you can make a reservation. here are the tours available:

june 3 � washington, the classical city
june 10 � national, political, and personal liberty
june 17 � freedom and sacrifice
june 24 � brutal mistakes
july 8 � british america

needless to say, if you or your family will be in the federal city during this time, these are highly recommended to power line readers.
