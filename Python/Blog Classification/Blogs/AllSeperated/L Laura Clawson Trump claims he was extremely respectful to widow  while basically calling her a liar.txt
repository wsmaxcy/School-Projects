Trump claims he was 'extremely respectful' to widow ... while basically calling her a liar

2017-10-25

donald trump returned yet again to defend his conduct in his condolence call to myeshia johnson—and in so doing, call sgt. la david johnson’s widow a liar. “i can only say this: i was really nice to her,” trump insisted, before going on to predictably undermine himself.

 
i respect her, i respect her family, i certainly respect la david. who i by the way called la david right from the beginning. just so you understand, they put a chart in front: “la david.” says “la david johnson.” so right from the beginning, there’s no hesitation, one of the great memories of all time, there was no hesitation.

i think she’s a fantastic woman, i was extremely nice to her, extremely respectful.
in short, “everything she said about the conversation is false, but i think she’s fantastic.” because myeshia johnson either said, or affirmed rep. frederica wilson’s account, that trump was disrespectful and specifically did not call sgt. johnson by name, referring to him instead as “your guy.”

also, it’s a minor note, but trump is claiming to have one of the great memories of all time (that seems to be what he’s saying, and not that the phone call was one of the great memories of all time, because he gestures at his head while he says it), while also saying that he had sgt. johnson’s name on a chart. his evidence that he has one of the great memories of all time is that he remembered a name long enough to read it on a chart and say it into the phone a split second later? we’re supposed to be impressed that he spoke the dead soldier’s name—if indeed he did, which the most believable people in this situation say he did not—because he had it on a chart in front of him?

and by the way, trump has still not produced the proof he repeatedly claimed to have that rep. frederica wilson was lying about his disrespect to myeshia johnson.
