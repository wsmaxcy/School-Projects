Only Baseball Player To Take A Knee Arrested For Brutal Thing He Did To A Woman

2017-10-13

major league baseball has been above this whole mess of kneeling during the national anthem. except for one player that is� bruce maxwell, who is a catcher for the oakland a�s. earlier in the week, maxwell told tmz that he had been denied service at a restaurant in alabama by a waiter who disagreed with the protest. maxwell said, �he was like, �you�re the guy who took the knee? i voted for trump and i stand for everything he stands for.'� the restaurant claims he is lying and i believe the restaurant. maxwell says he complained and got another waiter. this guy is a dirtbag.

the waiter, matthew henry, and the manager on duty at the time, anne whalen, have both said the incident did not occur as maxwell related initially to tmz sports. they said there was a dispute with maxwell�s party at keegan�s public house in huntsville, but it didn�t have anything to do with maxwell�s kneeling during the national anthem. in maxwell�s party of three, he was the only one who produced a valid id, so he was the only one who was served beer at the restaurant, whalen said. maxwell is making this up for publicity.

and staying true to his dirtbag label, maxwell, 26, has now been arrested for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. he �allegedly� pointed a gun at a female food delivery driver after 6 pm saturday night. tough guy huh? pointing a gun at a defenseless female� then getting busted for it and claiming he�s a victim. what a piece of excrement this guy is. this happened in scottsdale, arizona. i love scottsdale� best food and atmosphere in the world. they have great people there and it�s a fantastic place to live, except of course for this jackass.



maxwell was also charged with disorderly conduct. he looks more like a gang banger than a major league baseball player. just sayin�. in september, maxwell, who comes from a military family and who was born on a military base, became the first mlb player to kneel in protest during the national anthem. just shameful� his family must be so very proud. not.

there are no details concerning what led to the incident, but i�ll bet you this guy is guilty. the police say he�s in custody now and awaiting a hearing where he�ll be charged formally before a judge. hopefully, this takes him out of the game for the season. there is no excuse for this kind of behavior, no matter who you are. bet he was on something too when it happened. no sympathy for this asshat and major league baseball would be better off without him.



the scottsdale police said maxwell was arrested at his home and espn reported the catcher was in custody pending an initial court appearance. he�s getting a lot of press today and not the good kind.
