Trump’s Already Urging Policy Changes After NYC Terrorist Attack — Without Waiting For ‘The Facts’

2017-11-01

for some reason, he couldn’t do this after the las vegas shooting.

washington ― president donald trump on wednesday morning was quick to call for policy changes in response to tuesday’s deadly terrorist attack in new york city ― blaming one of his frequent critics, senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.), and urging more stringent immigration measures.

trump’s tweets ― which appeared to reference a segment on “fox & friends” that aired just 20 minutes before, featuring his former adviser sebastian gorka ― follow a pattern of him calling for political solutions in response to terrorist attacks, particularly those committed by muslims.

yet following the mass shooting in las vegas last month, white house officials insisted it was “premature” to discuss politics and dismissed calls to re-evaluate gun legislation.

press secretary sarah huckabee sanders claimed it was necessary to “know all of the facts” before bringing up policy — despite all the times the president has hastily proposed policy changes in the wake of attacks, sometimes without waiting for details.

schumer alluded to that hypocrisy in his response to trump’s tweets wednesday morning.

hours after the attack, trump on tuesday evening called on his administration “to step up our already extreme vetting program,” referring to the travel ban targeting a number of muslim-majority countries. however, that ban does not apply to uzbekistan, the country from which the suspect emigrated.

following several attacks in london earlier this year, trump immediately promoted the travel ban and launched into a feud with the city’s mayor, sadiq khan, who is muslim.
