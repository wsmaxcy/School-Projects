2017-11-21

bombastic, controversial and unabashedly conservative talk radio host mark levin has reportedly been slotted into the weekly programming schedule at fox news.

the show, which levin said will be called “life, liberty & levin,” will launch in late february and will air sundays at 10 p.m.

“i was approached and it was very enticing,” levin told cnn. “the format will be long-form interview, where we discuss philosophy, history, economics and the constitution as they relate to current events and the state of the nation.”
levin said the program would feature guests who are “not necessarily prominent people but people who are consequential in various fields.”
the show will air for an hour during prime time every sunday in place of a rerun of sunday morning’s “fox news sunday” program.

levin, who also hosts a show on conservative review’s crtv and a eponymous popular syndicated radio show, is a former reagan official and the author of several books, most recently 2017’s “rediscovering americanism and the tyranny of progessivism.” he’s been a new york times bestselling author seven times.

in a statement released by the fox network, levin said he’s eager to share his conservative vision with the larger fox audience.

“i am honored to join fox news, a network i have enjoyed appearing on as a guest for quite some time. as a proud citizen of the united states, i am delighted to share the significance of american values with such a wide audience and look forward to engaging with important guests about crucial topics,” levin said.
suzanne scott, fox news president of programming, said levin’s “passion for the principles found in the constitution” as well as his success as a radio host made him an attractive addition to the fox family.
