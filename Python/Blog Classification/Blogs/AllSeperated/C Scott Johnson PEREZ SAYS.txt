PEREZ SAYS

2017-10-29

democratic national committee chairman tom perez is not only a lawyer, he served as secretary of labor under president obama and as assistant attorney general for civil rights in the holder justice department. it therefore makes a certain kind of sense that he was invited to give the sixth annual birch bayh lecture at indiana university’s robert h. mckinney school of law.

in his lecture perez spoke on the subject of “the lawyer’s duty: social justice, racial justice, economic justice.” lawyers in attendance could even receive continuing legal education credit for hearing perez out.

however, i hope the students in attendance at perez’s lecture weren’t listening too closely or taking him too seriously. perez actually said this (audio below): “the electoral college is not a creation of the constitution. it doesn’t have to be there.”



the washington free beacon’s brent scher posted the audio and reports on perez’s ruminations here. scher adds: “the dnc did not respond to an inquiry into whether perez truly thinks the ‘electoral college is not a creation of the constitution.'”

the free beacon is in the news for its acknowledgment that it it paid fusion gps for research on donald trump. although many have sought to sow confusion about the involvement of a gop candidate that now turns out instead to be the free beacon, please note this: “all of the work that fusion gps provided to the free beacon was based on public sources, and none of the work product that the free beacon received appears in the steele dossier. the free beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by christopher steele. nor did we have any knowledge of the relationship between fusion gps and the democratic national committee, perkins coie, and the clinton campaign.”
