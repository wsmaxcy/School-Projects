What happened in Niger? Joint Chiefs of Staff chair briefs the press but offers little clarity

2017-10-23

joint chiefs of staff chair gen. joseph dunford jr. held a press conference on monday afternoon to update the public on the u.s. military presence in niger (which came as a surprise to many) and the early october attack that left four american service members dead and, ultimately, led donald trump to kick off yet another major controversy.

the upshot of dunford’s press conference? there’s an investigation going on and we’re not going to hear anything much we didn’t already know until that investigation is concluded. at that point, though, “we owe the families as much information as we can find out about what happened” and the american public, too, will learn more.

according to dunford, the troops did not call for help until an hour after the ambush started, and they had french air support an hour later. but why did they not call for help for an hour? no word on that. no word on whether there were enemy combatants killed in action. no word on whether the american troops were wearing body armor.

when dunford wasn’t saying he didn’t have the details of the attack, he was giving a master class in dodging politically loaded questions, whether on the appropriateness of directing tough questions at generals and retired generals or how to engage in the delicate matter of informing families of a loss or whether this is trump’s benghazi. it was a rare sight to see from behind a government podium these days.
