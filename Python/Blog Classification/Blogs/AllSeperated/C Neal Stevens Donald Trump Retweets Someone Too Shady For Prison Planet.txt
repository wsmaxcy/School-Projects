Donald Trump Retweets Someone Too Shady For Prison Planet

2017-11-29

how bad is it when alex jones’s prison planet has to warn donald trump not to retweet a questionable source? it’s this bad, folks.


jeff b noticed how bad this has gotten:

alex jones' right-hand man is publicly suggesting that trump might want to be careful about retweeting out those crazy sources. yes, this is the world we live in now.

yeah, someone might want to tell whoever is running trump's twitter account this morning that retweeting britain first is not great optics. 

that’s right, that’s prison planet calling out donald trump for retweeting britain first. britain first is an organization founded by former members of the fascist british national party. the organization conducts “christian patrols” of neighborhoods, who send groups of thugs to invade mosques.

yes, invade. that’s what they call their own activities. aggressive activities with the intent of sparking a race war in the streets. they’re so bad, even alex jones’s movement doesn’t want to have anything to do with them publicly.

and donald trump retweeted them! sad!
