Roy Moore is fundraising from 'God-fearing conservatives' in response to report he preyed on teens

2017-11-09

what’s an uber-conservative god-fearing republican politician to do faced with careful, detailed reporting that, as a man in his 30s, he abused his position as an assistant district attorney to prey on teenage girls? if you’re alabama’s roy moore, you fundraise off of it. that’s right, moore is out with a fundraising email claiming that “the obama-clinton machine’s liberal media lapdogs just launched the most vicious and nasty round of attacks against me i’ve ever faced.”

mind you, those “vicious and nasty attacks” are reporting with allegations from four separate women who don’t know one another, and in the most serious case corroboration from two people the woman—then a 14-year-old girl—told at the time. that’s what roy moore wants “god-fearing conservatives like you” to give him money to defend against.
