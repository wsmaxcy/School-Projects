Fox And Friends Flogs Trump's 'Tough Talk' On Trade As Top Story

2017-11-11

fox and friends took a page out of hannity's playbook and opened their show by ignoring the roy moore sex allegations and instead touted trump's "tough talk" speech on trade at the asia-pacific economic cooperation (apec) ceo summit in danang, vietnam.

when a show has to lead the day by calling trump the "salesman-in-chief" when he hasn't sold anything at all, you know times are tough for them.

with the entire political world, including republicans buzzing about the moore allegations, fox and friends opened their show with co-host steve doocy: "let's talk a little bit about where our "salesman-in-chief" is. he has arrived in vietnam."

they quickly cut to some of trump'and played almost two whole minutes of his speech they described as" fiery words."

after stumping for trump's tough words they then switched to people criticizing trump - cue laura ingraham video.

guess who they discussed next? nope, it's not roy moore.

c'mon, you can do it.

right. investigate hillary for campaign finance corruption - cue a tucker carlson video.

they just can't quit her.

finally, they put on griff jenkins to give the roy moore cliff notes and then they moved on.

is it a surprise for you to learn that f&f covered the roy moore story for four entire minutes during their three hour broadcast?

hannity covered the stunning virginia election sweep by the democrats for a mere six seconds tuesday night.

lessons learned.
