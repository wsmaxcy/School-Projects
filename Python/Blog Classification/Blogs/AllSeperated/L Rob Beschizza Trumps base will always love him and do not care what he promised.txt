politico sent michael kruse to a run-down pit town in pennsylvania to see if trump voters there are happy with his presidency so far. they're still with him, they don't care about his promises, and don't care that he's constantly golfing and tweeting. they just like the way he talks about the people they hate, and "boy oh boy do they hate kneeling nfl players."
