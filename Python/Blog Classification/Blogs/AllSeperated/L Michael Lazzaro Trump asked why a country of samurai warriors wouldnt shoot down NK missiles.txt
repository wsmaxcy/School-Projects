2017-11-05

before president garbage fire set out for his agonizingly long asia trip, he apparently did his level best to make sure the nations he would be visiting had a keen awareness of just what sort of garbage fire they would be dealing with.

trump questioned japanâ€™s decision not to shoot down the missiles when he met or spoke by phone with leaders from southeast asian countries over recent months to discuss how to respond to the threats from north korea, the sources said.
the u.s. president said he could not understand why a country of samurai warriors did not shoot down the missiles, the sources said.
this story is anonymously sourced, so we do not know if it is true. we do, however, know that donald trump is an unbelievable moron whose only knowledge of the world comes from whatever is on television that day, so... yeah.
