BREAKING: Trump Tells Stupid Pocahontas Joke In Front Of Native Americans

2017-11-27

pres. trump had a true john kelly facepalm moment at a white house ceremony commemorating native american codetalkers on monday.

in front of a portrait of andrew jackson — of all people — trump used his pet name for sen. elizabeth warren, calling her “pocahontas” in front of the assembled audience.

here's the video: trump calls elizabeth warren 'pocahontas' while honoring native american code talkers: "you were here long before any of us were here. although we have a representative in congress who they say was here a long time ago. they call her pocahontas."

“you were here long before any of us were here. although we have a representative in congress who they say was here a long time ago. they call her pocahontas,” trump said.
once again, the man screws up the joke, as the original nickname used for sen. warren following the news that she claimed native american ancestry was “fauxcahontas.
