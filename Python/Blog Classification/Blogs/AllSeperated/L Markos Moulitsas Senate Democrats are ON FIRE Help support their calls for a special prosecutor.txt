Senate Democrats are ON FIRE! Help support their calls for a special prosecutor

2017-05-10

popular vote loser donald trump is an idiot. if we had to have a republican president, who better than this raging moron? 

i mean, the day after he blatantly obstructs justice by firing fbi director james comey, he decides to hang out with the russian ambassador in the white house. and then, trump lets them take pictures of him looking all excited and happy to be hanging out with his masters! 

so not only are senate democrats threatening to gum up the works, but they’re using trump’s own images against him. and while poster props in the congressional chambers often fall flat, the one above scores a direct hit. 

meanwhile, republicans continue to stick with trump because they are also morons, apparently unaware that they’ll eventually get the trump shiv, just like comey did yesterday. trump doesn’t give a shit about anyone or anything, his party included. 

so by obstructing a real investigation into russian influence, republicans are now co-conspirators in the (successful) russian attempt to subvert our democracy. congrats, morons! but, it’s never too late to do the right thing. hopefully, with increased democratic pressure, we’ll get that special prosecutor our nation so obviously deserves. 

sign the petition: appoint a special prosecutor now!
