Eric Bolling Out At Fox News

2017-09-08

fox news has parted ways with host eric bolling, the network confirmed friday, just over a month after an exclusive huffpost report revealed bolling sent inappropriate text messages to current and former female colleagues.

news of the departure comes after two huffpost reports revealed a pattern of inappropriate behavior by bolling, who co-hosts “fox news specialists.” fox news will cancel the program, it said in a statement.

“eric bolling and fox have agreed to part ways amicably,” the network said. “we thank eric for his ten years of service to our loyal viewers and wish him the best of luck.”

huffpost’s report, which was based on 14 sources, revealed that at least three current and former fox colleagues said they had received inappropriate text messages from bolling, including photos of male genitalia.

less than a week after the two stories were published, bolling filed notice that he was suing this reporter for defamation, claiming damages of $50 million.
