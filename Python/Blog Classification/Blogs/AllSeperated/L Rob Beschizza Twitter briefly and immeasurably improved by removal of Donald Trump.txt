Twitter briefly and immeasurably improved by removal of Donald Trump

2017-11-03

on their last day at twitter, an outgoing employee shut down donald trump's account. it was dead for a few minutes, the internet exploding in shock and vain hope. then someone restored it.

through our investigation we have learned that this was done by a twitter customer support employee who did this on the employeeâ€™s last day. we are conducting a full internal review. https://t.co/mlarogiarf



the few, whose understanding of free speech is limited to a formless, angry entitlement to the accounts they are given on privately-owned media company websites, think trump was censored.

the many know a hero when they see one.
