CBS Shows Stark Differences Between Brave Military and Wimpy Liberals on 'SEAL Team'

2017-10-26

seal team on cbs is starting to become a reliably pro-american, pro-military show in a television landscape that doesn't give us much to enjoy. in the october 25 episode "collapse," the drama portrayed american service members respectfully as those doing good in the world and liberals as, well, ridiculous.

this episode has jason (david boreanaz) and the rest of his seal team protecting the american embassy in south sudan as the ambassador refuses to evacuate in an increasingly unstable political environment. the team is told that their job is to protect the embassy while americans remain there, and help to evacuate safely "if things go the other way." if you think this has shades of benghazi, you're not the only one. team member ray (neil brown, jr.) boils it down to "so...after it goes benghazi, the dod can say they had a tier one team on the ground." 

once in south sudan, ray is confronted by african-american journalist stefan bol who tries to get information by race-baiting. he doesn't realize that ray has a bond with his seal team that is far deeper than identity politics.
