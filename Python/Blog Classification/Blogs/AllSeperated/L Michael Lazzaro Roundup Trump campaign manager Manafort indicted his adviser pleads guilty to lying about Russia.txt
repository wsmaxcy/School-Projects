Round-up: Trump campaign manager Manafort indicted, his adviser pleads guilty to lying about Russia

2017-10-30

this morning, indictments were unsealed charging former trump campaign manager paul manafort and associate rick gates with, among other charges, conspiracy against the united states, conspiracy to launder money, false statements, and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign power.

the indictments are the first brought by special counsel robert mueller in his probe of russian government-sponsored hacking against the united states and related criminal acts during the 2016 presidential elections. in the charges, manafort and gates are alleged to have engaged in money laundering during their work for the trump campaign; while manafort was not being paid for his campaign work during his time as trump campaign manager, he was taking payments from "a foreign power linked to russia."

the indictments specifically charge that manafort and gates worked "together with others," who are as of yet unnamed.

also this morning, a guilty plea by trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopolous was made public. papadopolous has pled guilty to lying to the fbi about contacts between the donald trump presidential campaign and agents acting on behalf of the russian government. the government's complaint confirms that papadopolous was directly told of "thousands of emails" the russian government had obtained from the clinton campaign—before the hacking had become public knowledge—and that he worked repeatedly during the campaign to broker meetings between higher-level trump officials, including trump himself, and the russian government.

papadopolous pled guilty as part of a plea arrangement and is described as cooperating with investigator's ongoing probe—and, pivotally, may have been acting as government informant for a period of several months before today's indictments.

a summary of the rest of the day's indictment news and snippets:

• donald trump attempted a pre-emptive response to leaked news of today's indictments with, as is now usual when the trump administration has knowledge of an upcoming damaging story, a weekend twitter meltdown.

• after the indictments were unsealed, trump re-took to twitter to declare that "this is years ago" and "also, there is no collusion!"

• the official white house reaction to the indictments could itself only be described as divorced from any semblance of reality, with press secretary sarah huckabee sanders repeatedly insisting that the indictment of donald trump's prior campaign manager and guilty plea by a campaign foreign policy adviser "doesn't have anything to do with us."

• other republican hacks declared the indictments to either be a "nothing burger" or were timed to "distract" from new republican-led charges of something something hillary clinton.

• despite white house protestation, donald trump campaign manager paul manafort was, as is evidenced by his "campaign manager" title, one of the pivotal figures of the trump campaign efforts.

• while republican legislative leaders refused to comment on the indictments, other senators are introducing legislation to protect the special counsel and his investigation from being fired by trump if the investigation threatens to implicate him or his key allies.

• with a manafort indictment focused on money laundering from russian sources into the united states, mueller's probe is squarely targeting criminal activities that donald trump himself has long been alleged to be involved with. there is considerable speculation that mueller's indictment of manafort is intended to encourage the former campaign manager to cooperate with the government's russia investigation—by ensuring manafort knows just how many decades of prison time may await him if he does not cooperate.

• the also-indicted rick gates is one of the founding members of "america first policies," a political group devoted to supporting the trump agenda.
