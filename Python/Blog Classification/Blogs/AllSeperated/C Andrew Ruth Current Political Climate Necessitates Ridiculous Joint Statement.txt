Current Political Climate Necessitates Ridiculous Joint Statement

2017-11-28

only in times like these would we see a public statement from two consening adults about a decade-old consensual sexual relationship that went south.

in a court filing from 2008, rep. al green (d – texas) and his former district director, lucinda daniels, enagaged in a sexual relationship.

the relationship soured and daniels reportedly claimed she endured a hostile work environment and sexual harassment working for green and threatened to make the affair public.

according to court documents, daniels “threatened to go public with her complaints if the congressman does not per her money. green has done nothing wrong and refuses to pay ‘hush money’ just for political expediency. green will not be extorted or blackmailed by daniels. he will not be the victim of a shakedown by daniels and her agents. green demands vindication of his actions and now sues daniels for declaratory judgment relief relating to her workplace allegations and her quest for money.”

so, two adults have a consensual affair. things go bad. accusations get made and lawsuits get filed and we have to hear about it a decade later. what a dumb time to be alive.
