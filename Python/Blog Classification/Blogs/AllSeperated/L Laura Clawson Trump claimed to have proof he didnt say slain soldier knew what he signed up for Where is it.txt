Trump claimed to have 'proof' he didn't say slain soldier 'knew what he signed up for.' Where is it?

2017-10-19

more than 24 hours after donald trump tweeted that rep. frederica wilson “totally fabricated what i said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and i have proof),” we’re still waiting for that proof. no, white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders saying that trump staffers in the room when he made the call agreed that trump was “completely respectful” doesn’t count, especially when sanders twice refused to deny that trump said the words “he knew what he signed up for” about sgt. la david johnson.

trump didn’t just say he had proof wilson’s account of his call to myeshia johnson was fabricated, either. he also said of wilson “let her make her statement again and you’ll find out,” a threatening response that didn’t intimidate wilson a bit—she promptly tweeted that “i still stand by my account of the call.”

well, donald? to recap: he said he has proof. he said “let her make her statement again and you’ll find out.” he hasn’t offered the proof; in fact, his press secretary specifically refused to say he didn’t say it. wilson made her statement again. her office has received threats and wilson is now receiving protection, but what she hasn’t gotten is any kind of proof from trump or the white house.

he said it, and he lied about saying it.
