"i'm sorry that we even have to show her twitter comments," conway told the hosts of fox & friends. "because it's so far beyond any type of reasonable response that anyone should have."

"people are taking to twitter in the comfort of their very luxurious lives, pointing fingers, and as far as i can tell, never really helping in between the tweet storms," she opined. "never really helped charities, never helped people to heal, never try to reach across for understanding."

conway added: "i'm really happy at times like this that president trump is our commander-in-chief and our leader in this nation. because unfortunately every president has to help heal the nation at different times, different tragedies. but the rush to judgement, particularly by people who just see politics and trump derangement in every single thing they do, it doesn't help the victims and it's disrespectful to the dead."
