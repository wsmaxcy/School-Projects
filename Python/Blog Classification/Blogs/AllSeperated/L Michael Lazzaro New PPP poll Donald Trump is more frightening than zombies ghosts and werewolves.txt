New PPP poll: Donald Trump is more frightening than zombies, ghosts, and werewolves

2017-10-31

happy halloween. if you're hard up for costume ideas, why not go as the hell that is our actual life now?

[w]e tested donald trump against a litany of halloween related things and asked voters which they thought was scarier between trump and the items. voters think trump is scarier than ghosts (49/40), vampires (48/40), mummies (also 48/40), witches (49/42), zombies (46/43), and werewolves (45/44). people aren’t messing around with the devil though- they say he is scarier than trump by a 51/31 spread:
these new polling results will probably infuriate donald, who will work his wee little finger-stumps off on twitter tonight in an attempt to prove he is too scarier than the devil.

in other ppp polling news, trump voters like candy corn (62 percent) considerably more than clinton voters do (47 percent), and voters disfavor "pumpkin spice lattes" by a 2 to 1 margin. which brings up another fine halloween costume idea: hollow out a pumpkin, stick it over your head, and lie to everyone you meet about everything they ask you about. boom, you're pumpkin spicer.

in non halloween related polling, trump's approval rating sunk another 7 points in the last month (to 38 percent), 56 percent of voters believe him to be dishonest, 52 percent call him a "liar," and just 31 percent of voters believe trump has succeeded in making america great again. we should probably either put those 31 percent in quarantine, or at least demand they tell us what drugs they are taking.

oh, and 49 percent of american voters support impeaching trump. which is a new high, if we're keeping track—which we probably need to start doing.
