Breaking Bad Celeb Bryan Cranston: If you want Trump to fail, �f� you.�

2017-10-01

bryan cranston of breaking bad is not a fan of president trump�s. but he�s got a message for anyone foolish and hateful enough that wants to see trump fail� �f� you.� �president trump is not the person who i wanted to be in that office, and i�ve been very open about that. that being said, he is the president,� cranston stated. he once pledged to move out of the country if trump won the white house. guess he�s decided to deal with reality and being an american. good for him.

�if he fails, the country is in jeopardy. it would be egotistical for anyone to say, �i hope he fails,�� cranston, 61, explained. �to that person i would say, f� you. why would you want that? so you can be right?� gee, sanity out of hollywood. today is a strange day indeed. he�s right of course. it doesn�t matter how any of us personally feel about donald trump. he�s our president. if he fails, we could find ourselves in a world war and on the loosing end of it. you just know russia and all of our other enemies are salivating over the chaos in america.



cranston is starring in a new film called �last flag flying,� where he plays a foul-mouthed former marine. he�s anti-war, so i�ll probably skip that movie. but he flat out states that he wants to see trump succeed just as all americans should. �i honestly do. � and if you�ve got a good idea that helps the country, oh man, i�m gonna support you.� this guy backed hillary clinton, but when she lost, he got over it, unlike most of the left out there. he�s been a very vocal critic of trump, but that doesn�t mean he doesn�t support the president. he might not be perfect, but trump is ours� period.

�i don�t care if you�re a republican and i�m a democrat or whatever, i don�t care. a good idea�s a good idea. let�s do that,� cranston said in the interview. �we�ve got to get away from this idea that our country is political football, and someone with a different opinion is the enemy. assume they love this country as much as you do, and there�s always room for improvement. how can we make it better?�

cranston will never be a fan of trump� few in hollywood are. but he�s got a point� as an american, you support your president and deal with what is in front of you. if you don�t like it, get someone else elected next time around.
