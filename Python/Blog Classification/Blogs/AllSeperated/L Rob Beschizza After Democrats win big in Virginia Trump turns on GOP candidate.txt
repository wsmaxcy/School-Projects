After Democrats win big in Virginia, Trump turns on GOP candidate

2017-11-08

the democrats took the governership of virginia and wiped out republican control of its house of delegates tuesday. among the winning candidates are danica roem, virginia's first trans person to be elected, who thrashed the state's most outspoken enemy of lgbt people. after republican gillespie lost the governorship to democrat ralph northam, president trump immediately turned on his party's candidate.


ed gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what i stand for. donâ€™t forget, republicans won 4 out of 4 house seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!



another reminder to republicans that trump knows no party but one that wins in his name.
