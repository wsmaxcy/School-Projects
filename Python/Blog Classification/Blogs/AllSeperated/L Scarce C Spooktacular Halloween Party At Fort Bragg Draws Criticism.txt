'Spooktacular Halloween' Party At Fort Bragg Draws Criticism

2017-10-16

apparently this was the image chosen to advertise a children's halloween party at fort bragg, i can't imagine why little white kids in blackface as 'darkie' minstrels manipulated on strings by a white woman would cause offense, can you?

the image shows a puppeteer appearing to manipulate two children posing as puppets wearing black face makeup. the picture was used to promote a "spooktacular halloween party" set to happen later this month. the caption on the facebook post urged those attending to get their costumes ready.

"it's sending the wrong message to kids," said another local, james pearson. "white people control black people, you know? that's the way i perceive it."

fort bragg's mwr facebook page has since taken the photo down. it issued an apology saying the photo should not have been posted and does not represent the views of its organization.

despite that apology, the bingham family finds the post offensive and continues questioning why it happened.

"how can you expect us to want to support this installation and organization when you have no respect for our people?" asked tammi bingham.
