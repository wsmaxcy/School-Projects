McCain Snaps At Fox News Reporter

2017-10-18

when asked about his relationship with trump, mccain snapped, “why would you say something that stupid? why would you ask something that dumb?”

umm...because peter doocy (steve's kid) works at fox news?

doocy: "has your relationship with the president frayed to the point that you are not going to support anything that he comes and asks you for?"

mccain: “why would you say something that stupid? why would you ask something that dumb?”

“my job as a united states senator — you mean i am somehow going to behave in a way that i’m going to block everything because of some personal disagreement?” mccain said incredulously. “that’s a dumb question.”
