having evaded prison after committing two murders (although he owes over $33 million in a wrongful death suit) thanks to his fame and privileged pigmentation, and now having been paroled from a 33-year sentence for armed robbery, former nfl and hollywood star o.j. simpson will now devote himself to a clean and wholesome life. just kidding. whatever they pay their prostitutes, it could never be enough ï¿½ especially considering how the original nicole brown ended up.
maybe we should look to someplace other than the nfl and hollywood for our role models.
