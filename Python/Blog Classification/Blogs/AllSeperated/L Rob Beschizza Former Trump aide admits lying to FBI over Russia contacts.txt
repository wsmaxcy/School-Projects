Former Trump aide admits lying to FBI over Russia contacts

2017-10-30

though paul manafort's indictment was top of the ticket, it's the guilty plea of trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos that's proving bigger news today. paladopoulos not only admits he lied to fbi agents about his contacts with people close to the russian government in search of "dirt" on trump's opponent in the 2016 presidential race, but is described as a co-operating witness. for anti-trump folks who feared too much was being made of too little, it's a dream come true. jeer heer: "a member of trump’s campaign has pled guilty and provided evidence that the campaign did collude or attempt to collude with russia. that cuts to the heart of the mueller investigation—and it means that the president should be in very deep trouble."
