John Kelly’s Remarks On Civil War Blasted By Congressional Black Caucus Head

2017-10-31

“shocking that someone charged with defending their country, in some profound way, does not comprehend the country they claim to defend,” coates said of kelly, a retired marine corps general.

in the interview, kelly also praised confederate gen. robert e. lee as “an honorable man,” and expressed concern over the removal of numerous confederate statues ― an effort that has accelerated following the deadly violence sparked by a white supremacist rally in charlottesville, virginia, in august.

“human history, our culture is an evolving thing,” kelly said. “there will be, 100 or 200 years from now, people that criticize us for what we do, and i guess they’ll tear down, you know, statues of people that we revere today.”

trump has taken a similar stance on confederate statues. the president also famously argued that “both sides” were to blame for what happened in charlottesville and that some “very fine people” were among those participating in the white supremacist rally.

richmond’s statement reiterated his criticism of kelly for refusing to apologize to rep. frederica wilson (d-fla.), after earlier this month he misrepresented a speech that she made, while attacking her character.
