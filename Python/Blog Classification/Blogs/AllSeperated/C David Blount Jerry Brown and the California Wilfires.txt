brown vetoed the bill. incidentally, his sister sits on the board of energy services holding company sempra; the bill would have cost power companies money.
the author of the measure � passed unanimously by both houses of the legislature � now says the governor missed out on a chance to tackle one of his state�s longstanding vulnerabilities: massive wildfires endangering residential communities.
we don�t know that power lines were responsible for the many lives lost (at least 31 and counting) and thousands of homes destroyed. too bad governor moonbeam didn�t sign this bill, instead of the one authorizing prison time for people who refuse to refer to the sexually deranged by biologically inaccurate pronouns, or the one that made it no longer a felony to deliberately spread hiv. but in this country people get the government they ask for, and californians asked for jerry brown. by now, everyone knows exactly what kind of kooky irresponsibility that entails.
