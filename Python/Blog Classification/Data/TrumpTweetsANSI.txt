Aug 14, 2016 08:34:25 PM Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad! [Twitter for Android]  link
Aug 14, 2016 07:07:43 PM "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents! [Twitter for Android]  link
Aug 14, 2016 06:57:37 PM I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so! [Twitter for Android]  link

Aug 14, 2016 07:31:23 AM The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said [Twitter for Android]  link
Aug 14, 2016 07:24:48 AM The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary! [Twitter for Android]  link
Aug 13, 2016 03:02:38 PM We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres. [Twitter for Android]  link

Jan 7, 2016 11:14:38 AM .@SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win! [Twitter Web Client]  link
Jan 7, 2016 11:05:15 AM Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early! [Twitter Web Client]  link
Jan 7, 2016 08:24:31 AM Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 7, 2016 08:17:40 AM I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 7, 2016 06:28:51 AM It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 7, 2016 06:15:54 AM .@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott. [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 7, 2016 06:06:43 AM The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 6, 2016 06:15:24 PM Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received: https://t.co/NucdHBZAH9 [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jan 6, 2016 04:09:42 PM I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET. [Twitter Web Client]  link

Jan 6, 2016 02:22:27 PM Don’t like @SamuelLJackson’s golf swing. Not athletic. I’ve won many club championships. Play him for charity! [Twitter Web Client]  link
Jan 6, 2016 02:22:16 PM I don’t cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheats—with his game he has no choice—and stop doing commercials! [Twitter Web Client]  link
Jan 6, 2016 10:01:58 AM HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @EricTrump! Very proud of you! https://t.co/ZHMKIqnUwL https://t.co/IJzW2NDJyA [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jan 6, 2016 09:25:28 AM Germany is going through massive attacks to its people by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 5, 2016 07:28:31 PM I am in New Hampshire. Just received great news from Reuters poll. Thank you for your support! https://t.co/yzp9dGfbce [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jan 5, 2016 12:42:47 PM I don’t know @SamuelLJackson, to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many TV commercials—boring. Not a fan. [Twitter Web Client]  link
Jan 5, 2016 11:53:31 AM Wow @UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75,000 to around 10—bad management. No wonder they begged me for ads. [Twitter Web Client]  link
Jan 4, 2016 09:20:58 PM The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts, was amazing. 10,000 people going wild. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 4, 2016 03:00:04 PM Woody Johnson, owner of the NYJets, is @JebBush’s finance chairman. If Woody would’ve been w/me, he would’ve been in the playoffs, at least! [Twitter Web Client]  link
Jan 4, 2016 12:31:48 PM I look forward to being in Lowell, Massachusetts, today. I hear a very big crowd is expected--we will have lots of fun! [Twitter Web Client]  link
Jan 3, 2016 06:19:45 PM By the way, Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the Al-Shabaab terror video. https://t.co/gRannsRXJr [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jan 3, 2016 06:18:47 PM The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch. [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jan 3, 2016 03:00:58 PM Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 3, 2016 02:03:56 PM .@RuthMarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on Face The Nation.No focus, poor level of concentration-but correct on Hillary lying [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 3, 2016 01:13:29 PM .@chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that "attacking Bill to get to Hillary has never worked before." Wrong - attacked him in '08 & won! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 3, 2016 12:55:26 PM Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch. [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 3, 2016 11:45:35 AM Thank you for your support in Biloxi, MS! Let's ALL get out & VOTE in 2016, so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! https://t.co/RSZF12Kyhn [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Jan 3, 2016 09:27:19 AM Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 3, 2016 09:12:02 AM Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 3, 2016 08:59:20 AM Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate. [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 3, 2016 12:36:40 AM Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening. [Twitter for Android]  link

Jan 2, 2016 04:07:34 PM Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 2, 2016 04:01:10 PM When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 2, 2016 03:04:58 PM I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 2, 2016 03:00:17 PM Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 2, 2016 08:23:00 AM Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 2, 2016 07:17:12 AM .@JebBush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 2, 2016 07:10:21 AM .@JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 1, 2016 11:17:23 PM Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night. Look forward to it! 2015 IN PHOTOS: https://t.co/29z0XuXVf0 https://t.co/utrl0UnQau [Twitter for iPhone]  link

Jan 1, 2016 06:40:51 PM The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 1, 2016 06:24:13 PM I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it. [Twitter for Android]  link
Jan 1, 2016 06:00:09 PM Well, the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around! [Twitter for Android]  link
