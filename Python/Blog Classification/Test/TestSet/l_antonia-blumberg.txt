A Brief History Of Donald Trump Stoking Islamophobia

2017-11-29

With a series of casual retweets, the president has once again spread anti-Muslim sentiment.

President Donald Trump is once again promoting anti-Muslim propaganda.

On Wednesday, the president retweeted a series of overtly Islamophobic videos shared by British far-right activist Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader for the anti-Muslim group Britain First. 

The videos purportedly show Muslims committing violent crimes ― but, like many things on social media, they are misleading. One video, captioned “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” depicts a boy beating another boy. But the video’s original caption on a Dutch website does not mention race or religion, and local media reported that the 16-year-old pictured in the video was not actually a migrant.

The British government denounced Trump for casually retweeting Fransen’s posts. Downing Street said the U.S. president was “wrong” to retweet videos from a group that “peddles lies” and is “overwhelmingly rejected” by the British public.

Trump has a track record of stoking Islamophobia. Nearly a year before he won the presidential election, he called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” following deadly terror attacks in California and France.

Trump followed his proposal with an email to reporters in December 2015: “Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.”

Trump did not distinguish between fringe groups of violent extremists and the rest of the world’s nearly 2 billion Muslims.

Several months later, he declared, “I think Islam hates us” in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper. He went on to say that his objection was to radical Islam, but added: “It’s very hard to define. It’s very hard to separate. Because you don’t know who’s who.”

The president’s anti-Muslim rhetoric has hampered his efforts to impose a travel ban on non-visa holders from several countries, including five with majority Muslim populations. The Trump administration has claimed the proposal doesn’t constitute a “Muslim ban,” though Trump has called it one. And judges have pointed to the president’s numerous Islamophobic comments to question the ban’s legality.

“There is nothing ‘veiled’ about a press release titled ‘Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,’” U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson wrote in March.

During his campaign, Trump liked to tell an apocryphal story about an American general shooting Muslims with bullets dipped in pig’s blood. He also made the dubious claim that he saw “thousands” of Muslims in New Jersey “cheering” as the twin towers fell, failing to note that Muslim Americans lost loved ones in the Sept. 11 attacks, too.

Trump additionally suggested that the mother of a fallen Muslim American soldier wasn’t allowed to talk while her husband spoke at the Democratic National Convention. And Trump’s inauguration in January included prayers from a pastor who thinks Islam is “evil.”

After a Muslim American man killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Trump called for increased surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims were “trying to take over our children.”

The month after the election, an anti-Muslim hate group bragged about its influence in the White House, saying it had a “direct line” to the incoming Trump administration.

Early on in his presidency, Trump surrounded himself with a number of known Islamophobes, including former national security aide Sebastian Gorka and former political adviser Steve Bannon. Trump’s pick for national security advisor, Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn ― who was fired after 24 days on the job ― called Islam a “cancer” and said fear of the religion was “justified.” Senior Trump adviser Frank Wuco has claimed that Muslims “by and large” want to “subjugate” non-Muslims.

Trump’s comments have been accompanied by growing Islamophobia and a rise in anti-Muslim incidents in the U.S., which last year reached the highest levels since the period immediately following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Last year, a report from the Southern Poverty Law Center showed that the number of anti-Muslim groups in the U.S. had tripled in 2016.

Meanwhile, the president has been largely silent on attacks on Muslims, demonstrating a double standard in how he reacts to acts of terror.

After a man participating in a white supremacist rally drove a car into a crowd in Charlottesville, Virginia, this August, killing a woman, Trump insisted that he needed to know the facts before making a statement. 

But mere hours after an Uzbek immigrant inspired by the self-described Islamic State killed eight people by plowing a pickup truck down a bike path in lower Manhattan in October, Trump was already tweeting about ISIS and about placing heavier restrictions on the country’s immigration system.

In a November segment of “The Daily Show,” host Trevor Noah summed it up by saying: “When it was a Nazi, Trump needed more facts. When it was a Muslim, that was the only fact that he needed.”

Sarah Sanders Gleeful That CNN Won’t Be A Guest At White House Christmas Party

2017-11-28

“Christmas comes early!” wrote the White House press secretary.

CNN has decided its reporters will not be guests at the annual White House Christmas party as the network continues to feud with the Trump administration.

“In light of the President’s continued attacks on freedom of the press and CNN, we do not feel it is appropriate to celebrate with him as his invited guests. We will send a White House reporting team to the event and report on it if news warrants,” a CNN spokesperson told HuffPost.

When White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders got wind of CNN’s decision, she could hardly contain her excitement.

“Christmas comes early!” she tweeted, sharing a link to the article on Politico.

 
Sarah Sanders

@PressSec
Christmas comes early! Finally, good news from @CNN. https://twitter.com/politico/status/935655579296681989 …

The event is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon, according to Politico, and generally offers reporters an opportunity to mingle with members of the administration in a casual setting.

CNN’s decision highlights growing tension between President Donald Trump and certain media outlets he derisively labels “fake news.”

On Saturday, Trump tweeted, without evidence, that CNN was a “major source of (Fake) news.”

 
Donald J. Trump

@realDonaldTrump
.@FoxNews is MUCH more important in the United States than CNN, but outside of the U.S., CNN International is still a major source of (Fake) news, and they represent our Nation to the WORLD very poorly. The outside world does not see the truth from them!

The network responded on Twitter, saying:

 
CNN Communications

@CNNPR
Replying to @realDonaldTrump
It's not CNN's job to represent the U.S to the world. That's yours. Our job is to report the news. #FactsFirst 

CNN anchor Jake Tapper also responded to the president’s tweet by highlighting network reporters who cover sensitive and life-threatening situations around the globe:
 
Jake Tapper

@jaketapper
Thinking about @cnni and my brave and hard-working colleagues there who cover famines and wars and politics and terrorism and everything else. Amazing men and women, thank you for your continued excellence. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/934551607596986368 …



That didn’t stop Trump. On Monday, he tweeted that CNN should be in the running to win a “FAKE NEWS TROPHY!”

 
Donald J. Trump

@realDonaldTrump
We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!



In tweets containing several inaccuracies, the president has also accused The New York Times, The Washington Post, NBC and other outlets of publishing false or misleading articles.

Violence Against Transgender People Has Gotten Worse

2017-11-20

2017 has been a particularly deadly year for trans individuals, according to two new reports.

Fatal violence against transgender individuals has increased in recent years, reaching a record high in 2017, according to two new reports.

At least 25 transgender people have been killed in violent crimes in the United States this year, making it the deadliest year for the trans community in recent years, according to a new report released by LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign.


HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN
The report, released ahead of Monday’s Transgender Day of Remembrance, found that 84 percent of trans victims of fatal violence in 2017 were people of color; 80 percent were trans women, and more than 75 percent were under the age of 35.

More than half of the deaths occurred in the South, and the majority of those killed were victims of gun violence. Four of the cases HRC recorded involved altercations with police.

“The epidemic of violence against transgender people is an urgent crisis that demands the nation’s immediate attention,” Chad Griffin, HRC’s president, said in a statement.

Another report, released by the Trans Murder Monitoring research project, found that there were 325 cases of reported killings of trans and gender non-conforming people between Oct. 1, 2016 and Sept. 30, 2017. According to TMM, there were 30 more victims in that time frame than in previous dates recorded.

The majority of the deaths TMM recorded occurred in Brazil (171), Mexico (56), and the U.S. (25). Since it began recording transgender victims of violence in 2008, TMM has recorded a total of 2,609 reported cases across 71 countries.

HRC has recorded more than 100 trans victims of fatal violence since 2013, based on media and police reports. The organization estimates that their research likely undercounts the number of deaths.

“Some victims’ deaths may go unreported, while others may not be
identified as transgender in the media, often because authorities, journalists and/or family members refuse to acknowledge their gender identity,” the report states.

The 25 victims in 2017 identified in the report included three transgender women of color ― Chyna Gibson, Ciara McElveen and Jaquarrius Holland ― who were killed in Louisiana in the month of February.

The youngest victims ― Ava Le’Ray Barrin and Ally Steinfeld ― were just 17 years old.

None of the cases included in HRC’s report were classified as hate crimes, but the organization noted that transgender individuals are disproportionately affected by systemic bias and occupy a vulnerable position in the U.S.

Just 17 states and the District of Columbia have hate crime laws covering sexual orientation and gender identity, according the Movement Advancement Project, a LGBTQ research group. Roughly a third of transgender people live in poverty, and an estimated 50 percent will experience violence by an intimate partner in their lifetimes.

In the past year, discrimination against transgender people has been reflected in several policy changes and announcements from the White House. In August, President Donald Trump proposed a ban on transgender individuals entering the military ― a proposal that was shortly thereafter blocked by a district court.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo in October reversing workplace protections for transgender employees on the basis of “religious freedom.”

“There is still so much to be done to combat transphobia across our country and around the world,” Griffin and Trans People of Color Coalition executive director Kylar W. Broadus wrote in an opening letter introducing HRC’s report. 

“Nowhere is that more evident than at the doorstep of the White House, where Donald Trump and Mike Pence have made discrimination against LGBTQ people, as well as so many others, a top priority,” they added.

Alabama Governor Plans To Vote For Roy Moore Despite Sexual Assault Accusations

2017-11-17

Gov. Kay Ivey said she was committed to getting a Republican in the Senate.

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey plans to vote for Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore in spite of allegations that the former judge sexually assaulted multiple women.

“I’m going to cast my ballot on December the 12th, and I do believe the nominee of the party is the one I’ll vote for,” the governor told reporters on Friday, according to AL.com. Ivey was responding to questions from reporters after an annual Thanksgiving turkey pardon event at the governor’s mansion.

“I believe in the Republican Party, what we stand for, and, most important, we need to have a Republican in the United States Senate to vote on things like the Supreme Court justices, other appointments the Senate has to confirm and make major decisions,” she said. “So that’s what I plan to do, vote for Republican nominee Roy Moore.” 

At least nine women have come forward with accusations against Moore ranging from harassment to sexual assault. Four came forward in a Washington Post report published last week, saying that Moore pursued them when they were in their teens and he was in his 30s.

One of those women, Leigh Corfman, said she was just 14 when Moore drove her to his home into a wooded area, where he kissed and groped her.

A fifth woman, Beverly Young Nelson, shared a disturbing story about Moore during a news conference with attorney Gloria Allred earlier this week. Nelson said that while she was working as a waitress at age 16, Moore offered to give her a ride home but instead drove to a secluded area and sexually assaulted her. He was serving as an assistant district attorney in Etowah County at the time.

Kelly Harrison Thorp said she was working as a waitress at age 17 when Moore asked her out, allegedly telling her, “I go out with girls your age all the time,” according to a report by AL.com. 

Tina Johnson told AL.com earlier this week that Moore groped her in 1991 as she was visiting his law office regarding custody paperwork for her son.

Two other women shared stories about Moore in a report published by the Post on Wednesday, saying the incidents occurred when the women worked at an Alabama mall as young adults. Gena Richardson said Moore repeatedly asked her out around the time of her 18th birthday. She initially denied his request but finally agreed to a date, but it ended in what she described as a “forceful” kiss that left her scared. The other woman, Becky Gray, said that when she was 22, Moore repeatedly pressed her for a date in a way that made her uncomfortable.

Moore has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has attempted to discredit his accusers. 

Asked whether she believed the women’s stories, Ivey told reporters: “I certainly have no reason to disbelieve any of them. The timing is a little curious. But at the same time, I have no reason to disbelieve them.”

Ivey did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.

Several prominent Republicans ― including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ― have said Moore should leave the Senate race. President Donald Trump weighed in through White House press secretary Sarah Sanders to say “that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.”

The Alabama Republican Party announced Thursday it was standing by Moore, saying the former judge should be “presumed innocent” unless proved guilty.

Al Franken Accuser On Speaking Up Now: ‘The Tide Is Turning’

2017-11-16

Leeann Tweeden said there’s “strength in numbers” for victims of assault in the post-Harvey Weinstein era.

Anchorwoman and sportscaster Leeann Tweeden, who on Thursday accused comedian Al Franken of groping her a decade ago, said “the tide is turning” for victims of sexual assault in the post-Harvey Weinstein era.

“When this whole Harvey Weinstein thing came out ... I had to decide is this the time to tell my story,” Tweeden said during a news conference Thursday after publishing her story about Franken.

She continued: “I wanted to speak out 11 years ago, but people said you will get annihilated and never have a career again. And I was afraid of that. But I’m not afraid of that anymore. Could it still happen? Sure. But I’m a lot more secure with myself and my career.”

She added that “there’s strength in numbers.”

“I think the tide is turning,” she said.

Tweeden’s article detailing the incident, published on the website of Los Angeles news station KABC, said she decided to come forward because “there may be others.”

“While debating whether or not to go public, I even thought to myself, so much worse has happened to so many others, maybe my story isn’t worth telling? But my story is worth telling,” she wrote. “Not just because 2017 is not 2006, or because I am much more secure in my career now than I was then, and not because I’m still angry. I’m telling my story because there may be others.”

Tweeden accused Franken, now the junior Democratic senator from Minnesota, of kissing and groping her without her consent during a USO tour in December 2006. Franken was headlining the event, and Tweeden was emceeing.

Franken had written a skit in which his character tried to kiss Tweeden, and reportedly urged her to rehearse the scene backstage one day. When Tweeden tried to ignore his appeals, she said, Franken badgered her until she agreed.

“It reminded me of the Harvey Weinstein tape ... when the girl was wired up for the NYPD ― just persistent and badgering,” she said.

Tweeden said Franken assaulted her after they began practicing the scene.

“He came at me and before you know it, he put his hand on the back of my head. He just mashed his lips against my face and stuck his tongue in my mouth,” she said. “I was just disgusted. I was violated. I just felt like he betrayed my trust.”

Tweeden said Franken continued to harass her throughout the tour, and he took a photo of himself on the final day groping her breasts while she was sleeping.

Franken released two statements on Thursday responding to Tweeden’s story.

“I certainly don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,” he said initially. “As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn’t. I shouldn’t have done it.”

In a longer statement released soon after, Franken apologized to Tweeden and called for an ethics investigation of his behavior.

“I respect women. I don’t respect men who don’t. And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed,” Franken said.

Asked whether she believed Franken should resign, Tweeden said she wasn’t calling for such action. “That’s not my place to say that,” she told reporters.

Tweeden said that since coming forward with her story, she received a call from another woman alleging a similar experience.

“I haven’t answered it yet,” she said. “That’s to be determined.”

Tweeden’s fears that speaking up sooner could hurt her career are echoed in stories of dozens of women who have come forward with sexual assault allegations in recent months.

Actress Katherine Kendall, who was among the Weinstein accusers interviewed by The New York Times, said she decided not to come forward initially, telling herself: “I’ll never work again and no one is going to care or believe me.”

Roy Moore’s Wife Appears To Recycle Old Endorsement From Alabama Pastors

2017-11=13

Two pastors reportedly said they weren’t notified that their letter from August would be published again, and have asked for their names to be removed.

UPDATE: Nov. 14 ― The letter from Alabama pastors that Kayla Moore, the wife of Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, posted Sunday to her Facebook page appears to be re-release of an endorsement originally written in August before the GOP primaries, AL.com reports.

The newer version deletes three paragraphs from the original letter, which still appears on Roy Moore’s campaign website and contains sentences urging voters to “join us at the polls on Tuesday, August 15th.” 

At least two of the pastors listed as signatories on the recent post have said they were not contacted about the update, and have asked for their names to be removed.  

Previously:

Fifty-three pastors in Alabama have signed a letter throwing their support behind Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused of sexually assaulting multiple women.

“For decades, Roy Moore has been an immovable rock in the culture wars ― a bold defender of the ‘little guy,’ a just judge to those who came before his court, a warrior for the unborn child, defender of the sanctity of marriage, and a champion for religious liberty,” the pastors wrote. Their letter was posted to the Facebook page of Kayla Moore, the candidate’s wife, on Sunday and published Monday on Alabama news site AL.com.

The letter detailed the two times Moore was suspended from court during his tenures as chief justice of Alabama ― first for refusing to take down a Ten Commandments monument he had erected in the Alabama Judicial Building and later for defying federal orders on same-sex marriage.

The pastors described these incidents as evidence of Moore’s “unwavering faith in God and his immovable convictions for Biblical principles.”

The letter did not address that multiple women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. 

“We are ready to join the fight and send a bold message to Washington: dishonesty, fear of man, and immorality are an affront to our convictions and our Savior and we won’t put up with it any longer,” the pastors wrote. “We urge you to join us at the polls to cast your vote for Roy Moore.” 

“The Washington establishment has declared all-out war on his campaign,” they added.

Roy Moore, who is slated to face Democrat Doug Jones in a Dec. 12 special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate’s campaign arm, severed its ties with Moore on Friday. The committee’s decision came one day after The Washington Post reported that four women had said Moore pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. One woman, Leigh Corfman, said she was 14 years old when Moore sexually assaulted her in 1979.

Another woman, Beverly Young Nelson, came forward with allegations on Monday. She said in a press conference that she met Moore while working as a waitress roughly four decades ago. Nelson said Moore offered to give her a ride home one night in 1977. But instead of taking her home, she said, he drove around the restaurant and assaulted her. 

“I thought that he was going to rape me,” she said.

“He looked at me, and he told me, ‘You’re just a child.’ And he said, ‘I am the district attorney of Etowah County, and if you tell anyone about this, no one will ever believe you,’” she added. 

Carol Kuruvilla contributed to this report. 

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the circumstances of Roy Moore’s first removal from the Alabama supreme court.
