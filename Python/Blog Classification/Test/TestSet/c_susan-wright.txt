Jewish Groups Seek Answers To 2015 Incident Of Naked Tag In Nazi Death Camp

2017-11-29

This day can’t get any more bizarre.

OH, wait… some “artists” apparently did a piece of performance art, that consisted of filming a game of naked tag in a Nazi gas chamber in Poland.

Yes. Feel free to read that last sentence several times, to take in the full measure of bizarre.

The Times of Israel is reporting on this utterly disrespectful display, that apparently was filmed in 2015 in the Stutthof death camp, in Poland.

On Wednesday, the Organization of Holocaust Survivors in Israel, the Simon Wiesenthal Center and several other groups sent the request for clarification to President Andrzej Duda in connection with a video that the Museum of Contemporary Art in Krakow displayed in 2015 without divulging any details on where it was filmed. The letter was sent after research revealed the location was Stutthof, near Gdansk, Poland.
Specifically, the organizations want to know what sort of rules of conduct are exist for the site, how those rules are enforced, and if this group of “artists” had permission to film within the camp.

Normally, there are very strict rules of solemn, sober conduct required at the sites used for Nazi-era atrocities, out of respect for the victims. If this site was under the same rules of conduct, then there was a serious breach.

Following protests by Jewish groups and community leaders, the Krakow museum pulled the exhibition but then reinstated it, defending it as falling under freedom of artistic expression.

The video was part of an exhibition titled “Poland – Israel – Germany. The experience of Auschwitz,” which opened in 2015 in Krakow, about the former Nazi death camp’s impact on public discourse. It was endorsed and sponsored by the Israeli Embassy in Poland.
Seriously?

After heavy (warranted) criticism from Jewish advocacy groups, however, they withdrew their support and called for its removal.

“The embassy has learned of criticism regarding the video in question and has contacted organizers with a request that the parts deemed offensive be removed,” Michael Sobelman, the embassy’s spokesman, told JTA at the time.
Did they even see the video before approving it?

There’s nothing of any redeeming artistic quality to it. Nothing.

In fact, I really question what’s passing as “art” these days.

“It is the most disgusting thing I’ve seen in a long time,” Efraim Zuroff, the Wiesenthal Center’s chief Nazi hunter, said in 2015 about the exhibition. “They lied about it. It is just revolting and a total insult to the victims and anyone with any sense of morality or integrity.”
It’s making light of the horrors that went on in that camp, in the name of so-called art, and freedom of artistic expression or not, it deserves to be rejected and vilified.

Not Everyone Disapproves Of Trump’s Early Morning Tweet Choices

2017-11-29

It pays to look at who he retweets and who approves.

After retweeting several anti-Muslim videos from Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of Britain First HQ, Trump quickly got a warning tweet from Prison Planet. That’s how bad it was.

Britain First is a den of fascist, known for their “Christian” patrols of neighborhoods, as pointed out earlier by Neil Stevens.

The videos were inflammatory, showing a young boy being pushed from a rooftop then kicked and beaten to death. Another reportedly shows a man saying something in Arabic, before tossing a statue of Mary, shattering it. A third video shows a man on crutches being attacked.

What the videos have in common are that the attackers all seem to be Muslim.

Trump’s apparent approval of their existence is problematic enough. The fact of who he is retweeting only adds to that fire.

And with the flames already stoked, nothing quite tops off the day like getting the two, big thumbs up from David Duke.

“Trump retweets video of crippled white kid in Europe being beaten by migrants, and white people being thrown off a roof and then beaten to death, He’s condemned for showing us what the fake news media WON’T. Thank God for Trump! That’s why we love him!” Duke tweeted Wednesday morning about the videos.
Maybe the “fake news” are not showing these things because of the very real threat of racial hysteria and angst. It’s not like we don’t have enough in this nation. At a time when we need to be doing all we can to quell tensions, this is the absolute wrong message to be sending, especially from our president.

That those who actually approve of Trump’s choices for tweets are known white nationalists and former Klan leaders should invoke some measure of shame from the part of his fan base that don’t otherwise consider themselves to be the basement dwelling miscreants.

It should, but I’m bracing myself for the inevitable hissing and spitting directed at me, as if I’m more at fault for pointing it out than he is for actually doing it.

Newly Unsealed Documents Detail Trump’s Labor Lawsuit Payoff

2017-11-29


So does anyone remember the story of Trump and the illegal Polish workers from the 90s?

The story was out there, but in the mountain of unscrupulous dealings from Trump – Mr. “America first” – it seems to have been pushed back.

Now, the details of that case are coming to light, after a 2016 motion filed by Time Inc., and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press sought to have documents involving the case unsealed.

The case involved Polish construction workers, brought in illegally in 1980 to demolish the Bonwit Teller building in Manhattan, in order to make way for the construction of Trump Tower.

They were paid $4 an hour, and worked without even the most basic safety equipment, such as gloves, masks, or hard hats.

Trump often boasts about jobs for Americans first, but from his history and into the present, he’s shown how willing he is to cut Americans out of work and use cheaper, foreign workers when it benefits him.

Whether it was these Polish workers in 1980, or the foreign workers he vies for every year to come in and work at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

Back to those Polish workers, despite Trump’s boasts about his record with lawsuits and how he never settles, he had to pay out a tidy sum.

 Trump paid $1.375 million to settle the case, with $500,000 going to a union benefits fund and the rest covering lawyers’ fees and expenses. The case was settled in 1998.
This was backbreaking work, and by the accounts of those on the job, the Polish workers were frightened illegal immigrants, unaware of their rights, and often the butt of jokes by the union workers who were getting paid much more for the work they were doing.

It’s just one more piece to the puzzle that is Donald Trump.

For those who haven’t yet, I do recommend checking out the BBC documentary, “Meet the Trumps” on Netflix. It covers a lot of the background that went into making a Donald Trump, and none of these salacious tales come as a surprise, once you hear how the man was raised.

Secretly, Trump Is Still Clinging To Conspiracy Theories

2017-11-29


Before June 2015, the bulk of Trump’s political experience consisted of donations to liberal Democrats and causing a stir over Obama’s birth certificate.

In 2012, Trump announced a $5 million bounty to anyone who could produce then-President Obama’s “real” birth certificate, proving he was born outside of the U.S.

After entering the race for the presidency, himself, Trump was often asked if he still clung to the belief that Obama was not born an American citizen, and on the campaign trail, he seemed to concede that, indeed, Obama was born here.

A new report from the New York Times, however, suggests that maybe he hasn’t so readily abandoned the “birther” movement, after all.

A senator, who asked not to be named, told The Times that Trump is having difficulty moving on from his past claims that Obama wasn’t born in the United States.

Trump advisers reportedly told The Times that Trump has continued to talk about conspiracy theories that aren’t based in fact since taking office.
Not surprising, at all, given that Trump’s only real source of information comes from the National Enquirer, InfoWars, Breitbart, and Gateway Pundit.

He feeds on a steady diet of mush-brained conspiracy theory sites, so it is absolutely no surprise that he’s now privately questioning what he has publicly claimed to believe (at least for the sake of political expediency).

In recent days, it appears he’s now even doubting the authenticity of the “Access Hollywood” recordings, where he boasted of his wealth and celebrity giving him the right to grab women by their private areas, or to kiss them without permission.

Seriously… he heard his voice. He knows if he was there or not, and very likely, unless he’s suffering some sort of organic brain malfunction, he knows if he said those words, or not.

For their part, the producers of “Access Hollywood” have firmly maintained that the audio is legitimate, and has not been doctored, in any way.

Trump, himself, acknowledged it when it first came out, in October 2016. Now he wants to say it’s probably not him?

Yeah. It’s you.

The problem seems to be that a man with possible limitations on his mental capabilities, who receives his information from conspiracy theory sites and internet memes can be led to believe anything. He possesses no critical thinking skills.

Further, our problem is that somebody with this alarming lack of intellectual prowess is leading our country.

Leading Conservative Voice STRONGLY Condemns The Latest Failed Project Veritas Sting

2017-11-28

Apparently, I’m not the only one that feels like James O’Keefe’s bungled stunt against the Washington Post was a really bad look for the conservative cause.

On Tuesday, conservative pundit, Brent Bozell also came out with a strong condemnation of the latest Project Veritas sting operation.

You all know it, by now.

O’Keefe’s outfit employed a woman to reach out to Washington Post reporters, claiming she’d carried on an illicit affair with Roy Moore at the age of 15, was impregnated, then convinced to have an abortion by Moore.

Throughout the brief efforts, this “spy” acted strangely, and left easily discovered trails (like a GoFundMe page describing her efforts to expose the “liberal MSM” and containing her daughter’s name).

When confronted by a WaPo reporter, she led them right back to the Project Veritas office.

BUSTED!

Yeah, and while some want desperately to pretend this was just a minor stumble, to be overlooked, while pointing to O’Keefe’s past highly profitable efforts, Bozell is not amused.

@BrentBozell
Regarding WaPo/O'Keefe incident, this was entrapment, & the kind of "gotcha" stunt that should be condemned. If a liberal did this to a conservative outlet, we'd be outraged. Once again, O'Keefe is grandstanding & hurting the conservative movement. I'm glad the Post outed him.

And he’s right.

I do get the desperation of those on the right to rally around Roy Moore. It’s tribalism. It’s partisanship. It’s a learned response that rejects anything with a “D” beside it.

I’m no fan of anything Democrat-related, myself.

However, I’m even less of a fan of deception to defend what might possibly be inappropriate behavior by an adult towards a child. It blows back on all conservatives.

And O’Keefe’s response is less than helpful.

He immediately began trying to make more money off of his screw-up.

“Following months of undercover work within The Washington Post, our investigative journalist within the publication had their cover blown,” O’Keefe wrote in the email.

“This is how undercover work goes. This isn’t the first time that has happened, and it won’t be the last time.”
It should be the last time. You should be far more judicious about your targets.

And you should change your gimmick, before you ruin the entire movement.

Vice President Pence Repeats Promise That Trump Is “Seriously Considering” Moving U.S. Embassy In Israel To Jerusalem

2017-11-28


It’s the 70th anniversary of the United Nations’ vote to create the state of Israel. What better time for Vice President Pence to go forward and repeat a campaign promise that President Trump has already broken once.

I’m talking about Trump’s campaign trail promise to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This is a move that would signal to the world that the U.S. recognizes Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel.

It was a bold promise for Trump, and it holds a lot of significance for Christians and Jews, alike.

Jerusalem is the center of so much conflict in the Middle East, as Israel believes it to be their capital (it is), and the Palestinians claim it to be their capital (it is not).

Speaking at an event honoring the day, VP Pence said:

“President Trump is actively considering when and how to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,” Pence said during a speech in New York.
He was actively considering it on the campaign trail, but in June, he signed a waiver to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv.

Pence vowed that “the days of Israel-bashing at the United Nations are over,” stressing the U.S. will stand up for the Jewish state “because her cause is our cause, her values are our values and her fight is our fight.”
That part seems to be true. Where the Obama administration was decidedly anti-Israel, the introduction of Nikki Haley as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has been the most positive outcome from a Trump presidency. She has been fierce in standing up for Israel on the floor of the United Nations.

The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act calls for the U.S. embassy to move to Jerusalem, but every president since that time, every six months, has signed the waiver that would stop the move from happening.

The policy seems to be, and has been openly proclaimed by Trump, that there is to be a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians before it happens.

If that’s what they’re waiting on, then it will never happen, so it’s disingenuous for Pence to keep going out there and promising something he knows they have no intention of carrying through with.

Next month, Trump has to make the decision whether to actually back up his promise, or sign the waiver again.

Who wants to bet he signs the waiver?
