The program created is a blog classification tool designed to determine if a blog post is liberal or conservative. The program has an input of blog posts in the form of a specifically formatted text file and an output of a string that is labeled liberal or conservative. The user places the specially formatted text file in the test folder, runs the program, and the output will predict whether the blog is liberal or conservative.
The program is divided into two main parts: preprocessing and prediction. The preprocessing uses over 500 pre-classified conservative and liberal blog entries to find similarities and differences in patterns between the blogs types. These include lexical diversity, n-gram analysis, and other quantifiable scores. The prediction section of the program adds political weights to each individual quantifiable score to aid in correct prediction of political affiliation. The tests showed that the conservative prediction rate was correct 82 percent of the time while the liberal prediction rate was correct 72 percent of the time.
