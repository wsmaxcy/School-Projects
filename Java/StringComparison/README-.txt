Simple program that can be run and output is self explanatory.

b. Can be reduced by changing the cost of copy to -1, since both items at the j position in strings are equal
as well as neither are a space. Also change the cost of change the replace cost to +1 in order to say that
when both items  j  in both strings and neither are a space case. Make Kill and Twiddle both have high costs 
so that it would be highly unlikely at all or not possible for these operations to be used since they draw a high 
amount of cost.
